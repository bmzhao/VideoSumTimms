Top of Form00:00:06	T	Okay, ladies and gentlemen. If everybody, uh, could pay very close attention. We have-00:00:12	SS	(inaudible)00:00:15	T	Today we have an- a guest, someone who's here to film us. This has to do, as I understand, with an international study.00:00:22	T	I don't know the exact purpose of it, but, anyway, they asked permission to, uh, film a number of lessons.00:00:28	T	Among which, this lesson. Um, so it's not for commercial purposes, like you'd suddenly show up in a commercial or something.00:00:35	SS	(inaudible)00:00:36	T	So don't you worry. Uh, today we will- like I said last time, right? We're-00:00:43	SS	(inaudible)00:00:44	T	Young man, this applies to you too.00:00:47	T	We already lost a lesson for that BAVO test. Last time was the sports day.00:00:52	T	I just heard you came in third there. Not bad.00:00:56	T	However in this last lesson we'll be very busy, for we still need to finish a section with many problems that will return in the test.00:01:05	T	Last time we ended with, uh, the opening in the eye, the iris, which can become bigger and smaller...00:01:13	T	Becomes bigger and smaller with the aid of small muscles.00:01:17	T	Well, we still need to look at the lens, whose shape you can change. These are two things that seem very similar.00:01:23	T	People confuse them frequently.00:01:26	T	So we have to pay, uh, some attention to that. Other than that, we still have to discuss Basic Subject Matter Eight and Nine very briefly.00:01:32	T	Those are very simple, for the most part you can find your way through them on your own.00:01:37	T	In a moment you will get the scores for the BAVO test back. At the end of the lesson you get the report back. It has a mark as well.00:01:46	T	Furthermore you'll get-00:01:47	SS	(inaudible)00:01:51	T	People, please, uh, stay focused.00:01:56	T	Where are you coming from, this late?00:01:58	SN	(inaudible) //(she told you)00:01:59	T	//Well yeah, but you were almost here and then I saw you turn around.00:02:02	S	I walked up with her.00:02:03	T	That's not necessary, is it? Sit down quickly. 'Cause you're always late, aren't you?00:02:08	S	I'm just very busy.00:02:12	T	Um, so at some point you get answer sheets. We won't do it with the book this time.00:02:20	T	You'll get those at the end, you take them home. So you can do the checking at home.00:02:24	T	We don't need to spend any time on that here.00:02:27	T	And I hope that we have completed everything for the test week. You've been told what will be covered, right? Topic Six.00:02:34	T	All the basic subject matter and part of the additional enrichment material. It's in the brochure, too. We had that on the blackboard last week. So...00:02:40	SS	(inaudible)00:02:42	T	What did I- or I assigned Three for you, right? Enrichment Material //Three.00:02:46	SN	//There is another camera.00:02:47	T	Yes, for Enrichment Material One there are no questions, so this can go.00:02:51	SS	[laughter] (inaudible)00:02:55	T	And now we'll look at Basic Subject Matter Six in the book. //So-00:03:00	SN	//Sir, when will we get (inaudible)?00:03:02	T	Hello. In just a moment.00:03:03	SN	Does the camera see the whole class?00:03:04	T	We start at page 231. Put that in front of you, all of you. So get page 231.00:03:11	SS	(inaudible)00:03:13	T	Karen, please react when I ask something. First, you arrive late, and now you're just sitting there looking around.00:03:18	T	If you had been on time you would have been explained what is going on. But you were late again.00:03:24	T	So, just let it be with all that's going to happen.00:03:28	T	Page 231. Here we had, we had this on the blackboard last week, right?00:03:34	T	We were discussing the opening in the eye, then, the iris opening.00:03:38	T	And the iris opening can be made larger and smaller.00:03:42	T	Well, um, this little drawing represents that again. The book has more or less the same thing.00:03:47	T	The central section is the pupil, the opening, it is just a hole. It can become larger or smaller.00:03:53	T	And that had to do with the circular muscles and the radial muscles. These.00:03:59	T	Now, if the circular muscle--or any muscle--contracts, it gets smaller. So if the circular muscle contracts, the opening becomes smaller.00:04:06	T	If the radial muscles contract the opening is made larger.00:04:12	T	What can you compare this to in a camera? Who knows that? What's it called?00:04:17	SS	The lens.00:04:18	T	Not the lens.00:04:19	SN	Diaphragm?00:04:20	T	Right, the diaphragm. The diaphragm is actually the opening that lets through the amount of light that is allowed to fall on the film.00:04:30	T	If you look at a very simple camera, those real old cameras,00:04:34	T	I once had one myself, it had a little cloud, a sun and a sun with half a cloud.00:04:41	T	And what it had inside was, there was a knob which you could turn. And what really happened was:00:04:46	T	you had a disc in there, and the disc had holes in it.00:04:54	T	And you can imagine what position the little sun indicated. Here, at the small opening, was the little sun.00:05:02	T	And if there was a lot of light outside, you only needed a small opening.00:05:06	T	Then not too much light would fall on the film, otherwise the film would be overexposed.00:05:10	T	Too much light, if you take a picture almost directly into the sun, you hardly get anything on the picture.00:05:16	T	Well, then, of course, the little sun with the small cloud was here. And here the little cloud.00:05:21	T	The less light, the greater the opening behind the lens has to be. So you have the lens, the opening, and there you have the film.00:05:28	T	That film is light-sensitive. You want to be able to limit the amount of light that passes through.00:05:34	T	Well, in our eye we do this by making the pupil larger or smaller. And what represents the film in our eye?00:05:42	SN	The retina.00:05:43	SN	The retina.00:05:44	T	The retina. That's the light-sensitive part.00:05:47	T	And we also have a lens. In a camera the lens is in front of the diaphragm.00:05:57	T	And, actually, in the eye that's the same.00:06:01	T	There too, um- well actually, no, it's just the other way around. The lens is behind the diaphragm.00:06:05	T	Because our diaphragm is, let's say, the opening, the pupil. And the iris we can shrink and enlarge.00:06:13	T	With the aid of these little muscles.00:06:15	T	Now we'll, we'll skip a bit and go to page 200- let me see, uh, 256 in the book.00:06:25	T	Just get that.00:06:26	SN	A very large section, sir.00:06:28	T	And there you see the following story, which is often confused with this one. There you see a lens.00:06:38	T	So this is the lens. And around the lens there is a muscle.00:06:50	T	And this muscle they call the "ciliary body." Yes, and that, of course, sounds a little bit like "radial muscles."00:06:59	T	So these terms tend to get mixed up. So, the ciliary body.00:07:04	T	And in the ciliary body there are circular muscles.00:07:09	T	The ciliary body and the lens are connected with zonules. Those are not muscles.00:07:16	T	Those zonules cannot change form. They cannot become longer or shorter.00:07:23	T	But they are attached to the lens.00:07:26	T	Now, you can imagine that if the muscles in the ciliary body, if they contract, what will happen to that ciliary body?00:07:36	T	Does it get larger or smaller?00:07:37	SS	Smaller.00:07:38	T	Becomes smaller, right? When muscles contract they become smaller. So this gets smaller. What would happen to the zonules?00:07:45	SN	They loosen up.00:07:46	T	They loosen up, right. So if you- I'll make another sketch, in miniature.00:07:52	SS	(inaudible)00:07:53	T	This is contracted and then those zonules, they are a little loose.00:07:58	SS	(inaudible)00:08:00	T	Yes? Well, the lens, it can change shape a little.00:08:05	T	That also has to do- the eye, is on the inside filled up with a jelly-like mass.00:08:11	T	A kind of liquid-like material, and there is a certain pressure behind it.00:08:16	T	Well, if the lens, if the zonules are a little loose, then the lens looks like this. It is rounded.00:08:28	T	If the zonules are taut, then the lens is pulled, so then the lens will be... flatter.00:08:37	T	So that's in fact what happens. So you can- all you can do is make the lens more flat or round.00:08:45	T	When does it get rounder?00:08:49	T	Well? When does it get rounder?00:08:52	SN	When the zonules (relax).00:08:54	T	When these muscles are contracted, so in the ciliary body the muscles are contracted,00:09:00	T	the zonules are relaxed, then the lens gets rounder, automatically.00:09:07	T	Well, if it gets flatter, then this muscle is relaxed, while the pressure of the eye pulls the zonules taut again,00:09:15	T	And the lens is made flatter. At what cost-00:09:19	O	Mr. Smith, //may I say something to the class?00:09:21	T	//Yes, yes.00:09:22	O	Guys, the fourth period you'll have Mrs. Bruins?00:09:24	SS	Yes.00:09:25	O	She called in sick.00:09:26	SS	Ooh.00:09:27	O	Yes, that's sad, but everything will be all right. So you may go to the cafeteria during the fourth period, or continue to work on your own.00:09:34	SS	Yes! Yes. Whoo! Whoo!00:09:35	O	Okay? Thanks.00:09:37	SS	(inaudible)00:09:45	T	Okay, if everybody is ready again. Uh, last part of this. If you uh, compare this with a camera-00:09:56	T	Ladies, ladies. If you compare this with a camera, what is the similarity?00:10:02	T	This, uh, rounding or flattening? You can't do that with a camera, of course. You can't just change the shape of the lens.00:10:09	T	But what is it that you can do?00:10:11	SN	Zoom in or zoom out.00:10:12	T	Zooming in, right? Focusing.00:10:15	T	So, this, what happens here, has to do with focusing. If...00:10:23	T	If the lens is rounded, then you can see clearly up close.00:10:29	T	If the lens is flat, you'll see better, say, at a distance. Focused for distance.00:10:38	T	Well, what takes more energy, looking far away, or looking up close?00:10:43	SS	Close by.00:10:45	T	Close by, why?00:10:47	SN	You have to put it in focus.00:10:49	T	Karin, why does that take more energy, looking close?00:10:53	T	Why don't you tell me.00:10:57	T	Why does it take more energy if I want to look up close?00:11:01		And looking far away I can keep up a long time. I can stare into the distance for a long time.00:11:06	T	But looking up close my eye get tired. Why?00:11:09	SS	(inaudible)00:11:18	T	And your neighbor may think with you.00:11:19	SS	(inaudible)00:11:21	SN	Maybe I know.00:11:22	T	Go //ahead.00:11:23	S	//Because the- the ciliary body contracts.00:11:27	T	Right, the muscles in the ciliary body contract. So that takes energy.00:11:34	T	Muscles will get tired. If you, uh, have to hold something continuously, keep your muscles contracted,00:11:39	T	Even with a small weight, even if I was to hold just one kilogram in my arm, and I'd I have to hold my arm like this,00:11:44	T	Then after a minute that one kilogram gets to be pretty heavy.00:11:47	T	And you'll never last five minutes. Yes, and that's just one little kilogram. If you have to contract your muscle all the time, it will get tired.00:11:54	T	That's how it is with the muscles in the, uh, ciliary body. They get tired. And at some point you can't keep it up anymore.00:12:02	T	It's not working as well anymore. You're not seeing as well up close anymore, because the lens automatically flattens a bit.00:12:09	T	So looking closely takes more energy. But staring into the distance hardly takes any energy.00:12:16	T	Okay, well, that's the part on this enrichment material. It's important that you understand this very well.00:12:22	T	I formulated 15 questions, uh, specifically and only about the eye. They are at the end.00:12:29	T	Uh, you can already guess that those will count heavily, of course.00:12:34	T	I have the test, the breakdown of the score is given this time. Uh, the last part counts a little heavier again.00:12:40	T	After all, I have to create some variation in the choice of standards.00:12:47	T	And these problems, I 'm not afraid to say, they are, uh final exam problems from "MAVO, MAVO 4."00:12:56	SN	Why do we also have to (do that)?00:12:57	T	And I, I took a look at them. And you should be able to- you should be able to work out a number of those problems perfectly.00:13:05	SN	Ha, a number of them?00:13:06	T	Uh, the smart ones-00:13:08	SN	Boy, oh boy, that's nice.00:13:09	T	Or those with a bit of luck, maybe all of them.00:13:12	SN	Sir, (we're not going on) to the "HAVO", are we?00:13:14	T	So, I'll see to what extent everybody manages.00:13:17	SN	Are those multiple choice //questions?00:13:19	T	//Wait a minute. They are multiple choice questions.00:13:21	SN	All of them?00:13:22	T	//No.00:13:23	SN	//Is that A, B; or A, B, C, D?00:13:24	T	A, B, C, D.00:13:25	SN	Sir?00:13:26	SN	On the sheet there're all (those numbers)?00:13:29	T	Yes?00:13:30	S	Those aren't (open questions), are they?00:13:32	T	Yes, we do have a couple of open questions.00:13:33	SS	(inaudible)00:13:35	T	In a minute (inaudible), in a minute.00:13:37	SS	(inaudible)00:13:39	T	We will now, uh, look at Basic Subject Matter Eight.00:13:46	T	Page 235 in the book, please turn to that.00:13:49	SS	(inaudible)00:13:51	SN	Two hundred thirty-five?00:13:53	T	And those are, uh, the last assigned problems.00:13:59	SS	(inaudible)00:14:03	T	Guys, please get with it, okay? These are the last assigned problems we have to do.00:14:07	T	Uh, Basic Subject Matter Eight is about behavior. We talked about control and behavior.00:14:12	T	The greater part, the most is of course about control. Behavior is the last part.00:14:17	T	Uh, the last part is about, uh, all kinds of behavior, human and animal.00:14:23	T	An important part in it is the behavior for the survival of the species, and behavior for the survival of the individual.00:14:32	T	Well, an individual is one, singular, one organism.00:14:36	T	It's easy to compare that with the things you do yourself.00:14:41	T	Behavior for your personal survival is for instance making sure that you lead a healthy lifestyle.00:14:45	T	That you stay alert on the road, if you ride your bike in the morning, so that you don't ride into a truck or under a train.00:14:53	T	Uh, those are all actions that you do yourself, for your own protection.00:14:58	T	If you look at nature, you will see that many animals, uh, serve as food for some other animal.00:15:04	T	And conversely, of course. And many animals just don't let themselves be taken that easy. They try to escape.00:15:11	T	They have developed all kinds of techniques to flee.00:15:14	T	And, that behavior, escaping from a predator, making sure you're not getting caught, is an example of behavior for the survival of the individual.00:15:24	T	And everything that has to do with reproduction-00:15:27	SS	(inaudible)00:15:30	T	I don't know what you're explaining, but it has nothing to do with behavior. So please stay with it.00:15:36	T	Yes, so, everything that has to do with reproduction, and with the success of that, has to do with behavior for the survival of the species.00:15:44	T	A species can survive only if new individuals are born.00:15:48	T	Yes, that's the most important of course when you take a look at the evolution, you will get that later some time.00:15:53	T	That really focuses on: which animals are most successful? Those are the animals that reproduce the most.00:16:01	T	Because reproduction, survival in the future, that's really what we call success in evolution.00:16:09	T	We'll do a few problems about that. They can be done very quickly, so we can easily do that during the lesson.00:16:16	T	Uh, Basic Subject Matter Nine, Human Behavior, that's a very short piece, what you have there, less than half a page of text,00:16:24	T	That has to do- behavior has to do with biological causes.00:16:30	T	They say that behavior has to do with psychological causes and with socio-cultural causes.00:16:37	T	Well, I think you guys have had this in Health. And that certain cultures-00:16:42	SS	(inaudible)00:16:44	T	Ladies in the back. That certain cultures have different behaviors.00:16:50	T	Uh, furthermore, I think it is crystal clear that, uh, apart from culture, uh, parents, friends, caregivers influence your behavior.00:17:02	T	The school you attend can influence your behavior.00:17:05	T	But, of course, also your own will. It's determined by a large number of factors. They wrote a very short piece here.00:17:11	T	Just go ahead and read it. There's only a few questions about that.00:17:15	T	And two assignments relate to it. We'll do those, and then we are done with the chapter.00:17:21	T	Okay? So we'll do those problems.00:17:23	T	I'll read out your grades for the BAVO test. I'll return the report at the end of class.00:17:30	SN	Sir? How much does this count?00:17:32	T	BAVO test counts once, as a quiz. One time.00:17:36	SS	(inaudible)00:17:37	SN	One time. [German]00:17:39	T	One time.00:17:41	SN	Sir, (can we fail)?00:17:42	T	No, no, no, that's impossible, mate.00:17:45	SN	Are there any insufficient grades?00:17:46	SN	Are there-00:17:47	T	There is even a ten for the BAVO test.00:17:49	SN	Oh, my god! [English]00:17:50	SN	Who?00:17:51	T	Yes, I will, I'll come across it automatically, right. Okay Marieke, and nine and a half. Theo, eight and a half. Bob, eight and a half.

That's why.00:19:04	SS	(inaudible)00:19:07	T	Yes, you will get answer sheets from me.00:19:09	SS	(inaudible)00:19:15	T	Because we are going to do assignments still.00:19:16	SS	(inaudible)00:19:18	T	Yes, we'll review those, then.00:19:19	SS	(inaudible)00:19:22	T	Okay, guys, we are, uh, going to do the last assignments now. And I'll hand out some sheets. Fiona... Fiona? //Or-00:19:33	SN	//Yes?00:19:34	T	Well, I mean your neighbor. I always mix you up.00:19:38	T	We're going to do the last assignments.

Now.00:20:27	SN	Okay.00:20:28	T	Yes?00:20:29	S	Yes.00:20:30	SN	I already made those assignments (inaudible).00:20:34	T	What do you have?00:20:35	SN	I already made all the assignments through 29.00:20:38	T	No, that's no problem. But you didn't finish the enrichment material, did you?00:20:41	S	No, I still have to do Three.00:20:42	T	So just do Enrichment Material Three. That is //important.00:20:44	S	//Not more.00:20:45	T	No, no, no, no.00:20:46	SS	(inaudible)00:20:49	T	Are you also getting to work, gentlemen?00:20:50	SN	I'm going to be famous.

I guess so.00:21:42	SN	Are (we on screen now) or not?00:21:44	T	I would think so.00:21:45	SS	(inaudible)00:21:58	T	Through 29 and Enrichment Material Three. And especially Enrichment Material Three, guys, is important, okay?00:22:04	T	Practice that one properly, because I really thought of a couple of questions that you can answer only if you understand it.00:22:11	SN	Yes. (inaudible).00:22:13	SN	Sir, may I keep these?00:22:14	T	Yes, you may.00:22:15	SS	(inaudible)00:22:16	SN	Is this the last lesson, sir?00:22:18	T	This is the last lesson.00:22:20	S	(inaudible)00:22:21	T	Now- oh-00:22:22	S	(inaudible)00:22:24	T	No, no, no, of course not.00:22:25	SS	(inaudible)00:22:29	T	Ladies, you are not working on Enrichment Material Three. I'd like some action now.00:22:33	SS	(inaudible)00:22:37	T	If you don't understand it then you just ask it later.00:22:39	SN	We're just singing "The Bright Side of Life."00:22:42	SN	Karen.00:22:43	SS	(inaudible)00:23:03	T	Those are important terms that I underlined.00:23:06	SS	(inaudible)00:23:18	T	Gentlemen, just start doing those last things. Clear up that mess.00:23:22	SN	What is "accommodation"? Oh, here. (inaudible).00:23:30	SN	Sir, may we keep this?00:23:31	T	Yes, you can keep it.00:23:32	SS	(inaudible)00:23:39	T	I also have the answers of the D test, uh, guys. And for this last piece there is still the enrichment material to go.00:23:48	SN	These papers you may all keep, right?00:23:49	T	You can keep it all.00:23:50	SS	(inaudible)00:24:02	SN	Annet.00:24:03	SN	Just some brains.00:24:06	SS	(inaudible)00:24:20	SN	Sir, can you keep this?00:24:21	T	Yes, yes, yes, you can keep this.00:24:22	SN	I didn't see that.00:24:24	SN	What?00:24:25	SN	I didn't-, you can't see that, from such a //great height.00:24:26	SN	//When you're playing soccer, you watch the ball, don't you?00:24:28	SS	(inaudible)00:24:38	T	Ladies, please start working industriously. (inaudible).00:24:41	SS	(inaudible)00:24:43	T	(inaudible)00:24:45	SS	(inaudible)00:24:53	SN	Do we get all of them?00:24:55	T	You'll get another one later. But I'll wait with that for now. Because it includes Enrichment Material Three.00:25:01	SS	(inaudible)00:25:06	T	Up to where have you gotten with this thing?00:25:09	SN	Up to 23.00:25:10	T	Twenty-three.00:25:11	SN	You had to do through 24, but I didn't understand 23.00:25:14	T	What don't you get about it?00:25:15	SN	Here, wait a sec. "How come the image on the retina is perceived as normal?" And I didn't understand why-00:25:23	S	Here you had to say, "(Why) is the image of an object being (de)formed?"00:25:25	SN	I didn't understand that, I've read it but I don't understand.00:25:30	T	"What kind of image of an object is formed on the retina." Well, that, //that-00:25:33	SN	//That's the same, right?00:25:34	T	No, no, that's what we see here. We demonstrated that last time.00:25:37	S	Smaller?00:25:38	T	Smaller //and inverted.00:25:40	S	//Smaller and inverted. Oh.00:25:41	T	And your brains turn it around automatically. //So this is what you see, smaller and upside down.00:25:44	S	//Oh.00:25:46	S	I thought of a flat image //or something.00:25:47	T	//No, no, no, no, no, no.00:25:48	SN	Because you also don't see-00:25:50	T	"An image inverted and reduced in size," is in fact the answer you should write down here. And what else don't you understand?00:25:56	SN	Yes, no, that was okay, sure. But I understood that all right but.00:25:59	T	Well, this. How is this, then?00:26:02	S	"How come (inaudible)-"00:26:03	SN	(inaudible), so the brain does that, then.00:26:06	T	Yes, your brain turns it around, right?00:26:07	S	Yes.00:26:08	T	And if you keep hanging upside down long enough, like I said, they will also turn it around once again, right?00:26:13	SN	For how long, a day?00:26:14	T	Okay? Make sure you understand it. And don't pop your chewing gum like that, okay?!00:26:19	SS	(inaudible)00:26:29	SN	Sorry. I'm so sorry! Yes, fascinating, right? (inaudible). "An image inverted... //and reduced in size."00:26:37	T	//All right, how far did you guys get? You completed everything?00:26:41	SN	I just have //(inaudible)-00:26:42	T	//Looked at Enrichment Material Three yet? Then take a look at Enrichment Material Three.00:26:46	S	But those questions you don't have to make, right?00:26:48	T	No, but you'll need to be able to do those, (inaudible)-00:26:50	S	So you should just read the text?00:26:51	T	Yes, yes, yes, yes. So if you'd like to take a look. Where is it?00:26:59	T	This one, and then actually for //the assignment-00:27:01	S	//So read Enrichment Material Three and //then, uh-00:27:02	T	//Yes. One and two, you should just do those. And make sure you are familiar with those pictures and that you understand them.00:27:10	S	Yes.00:27:11	T	All right? So knowing that the first story I told you is about this thing here. The iris opening, actually.00:27:19	T	Right? Those small muscles are attached to this little organ. And the second story is attached to the lens.00:27:24	T	So they're located very closely to each other, but they're two completely different things.00:27:29	SN	And you have to know this as well?00:27:31	T	You have to understand it. Otherwise you can't answer the questions. There is no point in just memorizing it.00:27:37	T	Understanding, okay? Understanding.00:27:38	S	Usually when you know something, you understand it too.00:27:39	T	All right.00:27:40	SN	Sir? Do we get only Enrichment Material One- uh, Three?00:27:43	T	No, Enrichment Material Three, yes.00:27:45	S	So not One?00:27:46	T	No.00:27:47	SN	But then why did you put all the important things at One?00:27:48	SN	Yeah.00:27:49	T	Well, that's how- I'd first planned that but we had the BAVO test. I had- I had forgotten about that sports day.00:27:55	T	I had counted on two more lessons. Then you would have gotten this, too.00:27:57	SS	(inaudible)00:27:58	T	Okay? So I abbreviated it.00:28:03	T	Yes, normally we do all of the enrichment material. So this time it's a little less.00:28:08	SS	(inaudible)00:28:10	T	Because, if I- and don't you dare write in my book.00:28:12	SN	(inaudible)00:28:15	T	Ladies, how far did you get?00:28:16	SN	Um, here. What is um, and what is "the response"?00:28:21	T	What is what?00:28:22	S	What is the response?00:28:23	T	Well, what is that?00:28:25	S	Um.00:28:26	T	Do you know what a response is?00:28:28	S	Reaction of the animal.00:28:29	T	Right, correct.00:28:30	S	Um.00:28:33	T	Well, what is the response?00:28:34	S	Um.00:28:35	T	Just think about it.00:28:42	SN	If it reacts automatically, or something like that.00:28:44	T	Yes, but, what behavior were we talking about just now? Let's have a look.00:28:47	SN	The cat?00:28:48	T	The cat yes. What does that cat do? He chases a bird.00:28:52	S	Yes.00:28:53	T	What is the response then? It wants to catch //the bird.00:28:56	SN	//(inaudible)00:28:57	T	Yes, it wants to catch it.00:28:58	S	Yes.00:28:59	SS	(inaudible)00:29:02	SN	Sir?00:29:03	T	How far are you, um...?00:29:05	S	I completed everything.00:29:07	T	All done?00:29:08	S	Would like to see it?00:29:09	T	Yes, of course.00:29:10	S	Let's see.00:29:11	T	Yes, [laughter], that way anyone can do it. And Enrichment Material Three, what happened to it?00:29:16	S	[laughter]00:29:17	T	Because you don't have that yet, do you? You didn't do Enrichment Material Three yet.00:29:21	S	No, I didn't do that yet.00:29:22	T	Well, then get that out-00:29:24	SN	I can do it too, but-00:29:25	T	And start thinking about it.00:29:27	T	Okay? So Enrichment Material Three.00:29:30	S	Now that will be tough.00:29:31	T	Okay?00:29:32	SN	Those blind spots, I don't see them. I can- If I look at the drawing, I don't see (it).00:29:38	T	Yes, however, you should- Because which drawing did you use for that? This one?00:29:43	S	This one. As we were meant to.00:29:44	T	//Yes, yes, yes.00:29:45	S	//You had to hold it in front of you like this. I used that one and it didn't work that way.00:29:47	T	Did you close one eye?00:29:48	S	Yes, and that didn't work.00:29:51	T	//Yes.00:29:52	SN	//It should, shouldn't it?00:29:53	T	That should work, though. Then you should increase- then you should increase or reduce the distance a little.00:29:58	SN	Oh, okay.00:29:59	T	Either move it closer or farther away. Everybody has a blind spot,00:30:02	SN	Yes.00:30:03	T	and you should- you should be able to find it.00:30:04	SN	//Look out. The bag, behind you.00:30:05	T	//Just move your book up and down.00:30:07	S	Put that bag away. He might trip over it.00:30:09	SN	//Last time we, last time we-00:30:11	S	Tuesday afternoon we worked on biology together.00:30:14	T	Yes.00:30:15	S	And now I left my papers with her, from assignment 30 on.00:30:18	T	Okay, you can check it at home.00:30:20	S	Yes?00:30:21	T	But what you- what you didn't do is Enrichment Material Three.00:30:25	S	//No, not yet.00:30:26	T	//Did you? Well, that one you can- For that one you should check and see if you really understand it.00:30:29	S	Yes.00:30:30	T	Like I said, that's very important. So, take a good look at it.00:30:33	SN	And this here...00:30:34	T	Yes.00:30:35	S	Here it failed only ten times, and here 18 times and here 30 times. I failed more often with both eyes than with one eye.00:30:41	T	Then you, probably- you must have gone very slowly with one eye, not as fast.00:30:48	T	It can't be that you kept the same pace. Impossible.00:30:52	T	It is impossible to work more accurately with one eye than with two.00:30:55	S	Oh.00:30:56	T	So I think that the pace at which you put down the dots, that there is a large variation in that.00:31:02	T	While actually you're supposed to be at the same pace. And then it must be that with two eyes you can see much better.00:31:10	SN	Yes, yes.00:31:11	T	Yes?00:31:14	T	How far did you guys get?00:31:15	SN	I'm at 25.00:31:16	SN	I am checking.00:31:17	T	So almost everything is done?00:31:18	S	Yes.00:31:20	S	But I've already checked that assignment for Basic Subject Matter One, right?00:31:24	T	Yes, we checked that already I believe. Can I see what you produced so far?00:31:33	T	Your handwriting is, uh...00:31:34	SN	No, (inaudible).00:31:35	T	Lousy, huh? Getting lousy.00:31:38	S	No, it's always been like that.00:31:40	SN	Sir?00:31:41	T	But you could type real fast, right?00:31:42	SN	Yes, that I can.00:31:43	T	That's what I thought. Okay, now just do Enrichment Material Three. //Yes?00:31:48	SN	//Sir, I have a //question?00:31:50	T	And that is?00:31:51	S	For, um: somebody looks at the tip of a pencil while it's coming closer to the eye. How does the form changes? It gets larger, right?00:31:57	T	No, but, the lens does not get bigger, does it? It gets rounder or flatter.00:32:04	T	The lens cannot get bigger, so... What question were you talking about?00:32:07	S	Three.00:32:08	T	Three. "Someone is looking at the tip of a pencil while that's..."00:32:16	T	So how does it shape-? They are talking about the shape, aren't they? A shape is not larger or smaller.00:32:21	T	You have- have something far off and you bring it closer and you want to keep seeing it clearly.00:32:27	S	Then it gets flatter, I think.00:32:29	T	No.00:32:30	S	It becomes more rounded?00:32:31	T	It gets rounder, yes.00:32:35	T	That is what it says up here, see?00:32:36	S	Oh, wait it says here //that's called accommodating.00:32:37	T	//Look, look. No, you have to look at this picture. Here something is at a distance. Yes, then you see the lens is flat.00:32:45	T	And you see the zonules here, they are taut.00:32:47	T	Here you have the zonules, and they drew the muscles heavier there, you see?00:32:51	S	Yes.00:32:52	T	And those zonules a little more loose. So yes, it is drawn small, but...00:32:55	T	Here you see something up close, in focus. That will cost me energy, I said earlier.00:33:00	T	You have to tense that muscle. At a distance it takes no energy.00:33:03	S	Yes.00:33:04	T	So when I bring something closer I have to make the lens more and more rounded. Simply because the light rays, I have to break those more.00:33:11	S	Yes, okay.00:33:12	T	Yes?00:33:13	S	Yes, //no okay.00:33:14	T	//That's what this is all about. The light has to be broken more and more acutely. And that's what it's all about.00:33:20	SN	Sir? That assignment, I didn't do that one yet. So may I keep this?00:33:25	T	Yes, you can keep the whole thing. You //may take it with you.00:33:27	S	//Yes, this one I don't need any more.00:33:29	T	Why not?00:33:30	S	Because I checked all of them already.00:33:31	T	Yes, take it anyway. That you //can-00:33:33	S	//Should I start doing the enrichment material?00:33:35	T	Enrichment Material Three, yes.00:33:36	SS	(inaudible)00:33:40	SN	Whether it is behavior or isn't behavior, but don't we get that in the test anyway? That you have to just say-00:33:46	T	What do you mean? They're asking you for your own opinion, I think, or not?00:33:49	S	No.00:33:50	T	"(Determine) whether the following examples are, or are not examples of behavior." Yes, you can, you'll get questions about that, yes.00:33:56	S	Okay. So just kind of like, um, "Is it behavior or not?"00:33:59	T	Yes.00:34:00	S	Yes, okay.00:34:03	T	So, that's not too difficult, is it?00:34:04	S	No, okay but I just wanted to know if we're going to get that.00:34:08	T	It goes with the basic subject matter. You get a test on all basic subject matter.00:34:13	SS	(inaudible)00:34:16	T	Well, ladies, where- how far have you gotten?00:34:18	SN	I've just written down the important terms.00:34:22	T	Written down the important terms.00:34:24	SN	(Yes, this).00:34:25	T	Okay, so, the last things.00:34:27	SS	(inaudible)00:34:32	T	Yes, you get this one now. Guys, these are the last solutions, also from the, um, enrichment material. In a moment you also get the reports back.00:34:42	SS	(inaudible)00:35:21	T	Wasn't there anything like, um, a form the students needed to fill out? You've got that with you? Okay.00:35:29	SS	(inaudible)00:35:33	SN	And here it says, "And the enrichment material," but I don't have a clue what exactly that is.00:35:38	T	Okay people, these are the last solutions.00:35:40	SN	(inaudible)00:35:41	T	That was nonsense. There you had left it out.00:35:44	SN	And is this only Enrichment Material Three?00:35:45	T	Yes, so Enrichment Material Three, is included, there, right?00:35:49	S	Yes, here.00:35:50	T	Yes, yes, yes. Yes, I left One in there, too. I just figured, for whoever is interested.00:35:55	SS	(inaudible)00:36:03	T	Well, the reports, just a moment, ladies and gentlemen. I should tell you this.00:36:09	T	I, um, discussed this with Mr. Verhoeven, and you know that normally I never give tens.00:36:14	T	Unless you really earned it in terms of points. For reports I consider it just a little too much.00:36:20	T	It may distort your image a bit at some point.00:36:23	T	Mr. Verhoeven said that it won't hurt for once. He has looked at a few things with me.00:36:27	T	We checked if it was in a little folder.00:36:30	T	If the cover looked decent. Naturally, if all assignments were in fact completed.00:36:34	T	Uh, I read a number of the assignments. Well, you did a great job. The assignments were all done excellently.00:36:42	T	Most of you put a fair amount of time into it. //And therefore we also have-00:36:45	SS	//A fair amount?00:36:47	T	Okay, "a lot."00:36:49	SN	A lot? Twenty-four pages, sir.00:36:51	SN	Yeah, I easily spent a day on it.00:36:53	T	And therefore we awarded some tens this time.00:36:56	T	Uh, it counts twice, so no- You can note it twice.00:37:01	SN	(inaudible) sheets?00:37:02	T	And, um, we hand it out- Yes, of course.00:37:04	SS	(inaudible)00:37:11	T	Two helpers.00:37:13	SS	(inaudible)00:37:18	T	All right, hand it out quickly.00:37:20	SS	(inaudible)00:37:24	SN	Hey man, you already got a ten.00:37:26	SN	A nine and a half.00:37:27	SN	Yeah, you got a ten. Look here: a ten.00:37:31	SN	Yes, you got a ten.00:37:33	SN	Eddie, you got a ten.00:37:35	T	You had- did you already have a ten?00:37:37	SN	Yes, for the (test).00:37:38	T	For the BAVO?00:37:39	S	Yes.00:37:40	T	Yes.00:37:41	SS	(inaudible)00:37:42	SN	Good heavens!00:37:47	T	I did- I did it also because the test is difficult.00:37:52	SN	What do you have?00:37:53	SN	A nine and a half.00:37:55	SN	I've got a ten!00:37:58	SN	Sir, do I have a nine and a half as well?00:38:01	T	Well, um, I can't remember just like that.00:38:03	SS	(inaudible)00:38:07	SN	No red at all.00:38:11	SN	Let me see. Didn't you fill this out?00:38:14	SN	Filled out what?00:38:15	SN	This.00:38:16	SN	Well, we didn't need to.00:38:17	SN	I had 30 points.00:38:20	SN	Did you study it pretty well?00:38:22	SN	I had 12.00:38:23	SN	I had only eight.00:38:26	T	Can you- can you stay seated? Stay seated. Please.00:38:32	SS	(inaudible)00:38:33	T	Do they have to fill in those forms now?00:38:37	T	Oh, there's-00:38:39	SN	I've got a nine and a half. But I (don't see anything marked down).00:38:44	T	Yes, but I'm not talking about (how things are being marked down).00:38:47	T	I have looked like--because you're going one class higher, right--how should a project look?00:38:54	T	Is it in a neat folder? That's one. Next thing you're going to look at is: how does the front page look?00:39:00	T	That is- if you're in tenth grade, you can't turn in something looking like this. It's not badly done. You've put some time in it.00:39:04	T	But altogether it should look more professional, let's put it that way. You see?00:39:09	S	With a computer or something like that?00:39:11	T	Yes, or- or at least so that it looks professional. For the rest you did it pretty well.00:39:19	T	But there are also people who have--and that's just what makes that ten--00:39:21	T	they've got all the assignments, they've got it in a folder, they've also got a front page.00:39:27	T	They did just a few extra things. Searched an extra picture to go with certain subject.00:39:32	T	And you didn't do that. Well, and Mr. Verhoeven said, "When there's nothing extra, then you'll take a half a grade off.00:39:39	T	If it is not in a folder you'll take half a grade off." That's how we had certain rules.00:39:42	S	I see.00:39:43	T	For the rest the assignments are worked out very well. But just that little extra something, for the //ten.00:39:47	S	//Yes, yes.00:39:49	T	Okay? Guys, don't stand in front of the door. Just go sit on your seats.00:39:55	T	We're not going to hang around at the door.
