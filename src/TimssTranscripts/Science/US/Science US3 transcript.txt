We're gonna get started on the lab today.00:20:18	T	Shh. Folks, I need your attention up here, please.00:20:23	T	I'm glad you guys are having so much fun coloring inside the letters, but (if) I could get your attention up here, I would really appreciate it.00:20:34	T	We went over this yesterday. I'm just gonna recap it today because it's been 24 hours, and I know you forgot.00:20:43	T	You're just gathering three pieces of data from each pulley setup.00:20:48	T	You're gathering the effort distance, the effort force and the resistance force.00:20:55	T	As I went over yesterday, you measure the resistance force just by picking the weight up with the scale,00:21:05	T	and you measure the effort distance by using the ruler in centimeters to measure how far you pull the string00:21:15	T	when you lift the weight by 10 centimeters.00:21:18	T	The resistance distance in every case is 10 centimeters.00:21:23	T	If I can have your attention back here-00:21:28	T	just quickly go over this for the first setup again.00:21:31	T	There are two rulers back at the station.00:21:39	T	You'll be using both of them at the same time.00:21:42	T	One person is gonna be measuring resistance distance; one person is gonna be measuring effort distance.00:21:48	T	So you'll have one person using the centimeter side of the ruler. There's an inches side.00:21:55	T	Don't use the inches; use the centimeters. They're gonna be measuring how high the bottom of the weight goes up.00:22:02	T	When it's at 10 centimeters, that's as far as you're going.00:22:06	T	While they're doing that, the person applying the effort to the simple machine, the person pulling on the string,00:22:15	T	is gonna be measuring how far they have moved the string to raise the weight ten centimeters.00:22:23	T	Now, some people in earlier classes were just writing down the numbers on here.00:22:29	T	They would just- be holding them here and go, "Oh, that's 55."00:22:32	T	That's not how it works. It's how far it moves.00:22:36	T	So when the person is reading the resistance and they say, "Oh, that's 10 centimeters," on this thing, then you'll stop.00:22:43	T	Where did you start? Where did you end?00:22:46	T	If you started at 55 and went to 60 or went to 45,00:22:51	T	depending on how you turned, how far would that be?00:22:54	T	Say, you started at 55, and you pulled the string down to 60 on the ruler. How far would that be?00:23:00	SS	Five.00:23:01	T	It would be five centimeters. Say, you started at 55, and it went to 45. How far would that be?00:23:07	SN	Ten centimeters.00:23:08	T	It would be 10 centimeters. So it's how far you exert the force.00:23:14	T	Audrey. It's the distance over which you apply the effort.00:23:21	T	That's what effort distance is.00:23:23	T	So if you start here and extend it that far, that's the effort distance.00:23:28	T	A couple things to be aware of when you're doing your measurements.00:23:32	T	If you pull it at an angle, your measurements won't be very accurate00:23:36	T	so you want to make sure that you're pulling straight down in the direction that you are measuring.00:23:42	T	Secondly, you want to make sure that, uh, when you're measuring the force you're also pulling straight down.00:23:49	T	Straight down really helps on this lab. All right. So that's effort distance.00:23:53	T	Probably one of the harder things to measure in the lab. We went over- we went over resistance distance.00:24:00	T	What is it for every experiment that we're doing?00:24:02	SN	Newtons.00:24:04	T	That's force, as in Newtons. But what's the resistance distance? Look on your lab. It's already filled out.00:24:10	SN	Ten-00:24:11	SS	Ten centimeters.00:24:12	T	It's 10 centimeters. So 10 centimeters is how far we're lifting the weight up.00:24:16	T	How far we pull this to lift the weight 10 centimeters is our effort distance.00:24:20	T	The forces- I went over those yesterday. Got to zero these things.00:24:24	T	The resistance force is just how much the resistance weighs, and as you guys just said a second ago, we are measuring it in what?00:24:31	S	Newtons.00:24:32	T	We are measuring it in Newtons. Estimate to the closest quarter Newton.00:24:36	T	For effort distance- again, I showed you that yesterday- you need to tie a loop in the string, you need to zero it out upside down,00:24:44	T	and you're gonna pull, and it works again much better if you pull upside down.00:24:49	T	If you pull upside down- I'm sorry. Not pull upside down.00:24:51	T	Pull straight down. If you pull straight down, you'll get much more accurate measurements.00:24:56	T	If you do it off to the side, it just, uh- it's not gonna be as accurate, and again estimate to the closest quarter.00:25:01	T	Those are the only three things you're doing for each pulley setup. There's four pulley setups.00:25:06	T	You're not gonna get them all done today. You might not even get the first one done today. That's okay.00:25:12	T	It's better that you get accurate data than that you just rush through all of these. We got time.00:25:17	T	We're gonna spend a number of days on this.00:25:20	T	Mechanical advantage, lastly. When we've got all your data, we're gonna go back and do mechanical advantage,00:25:26	T	but you gotta- have to have good data so don't worry about mechanical advantage yet.00:25:30	T	All right. At this time I'm gonna divide you up into 10 groups and send you to a station.00:25:35	T	Get started on- well, you can do any of the pulley setups you want.00:25:38	T	It doesn't matter whether you start with the first one or not, but let me sort of divide you guys up here.00:25:48	T	That'll actually work out just, uh, fine.00:25:52	T	Cindy, I'm gonna go ahead and, uh, put you and Matt with Miguel, and you guys will be at the first station over there.00:25:59	T	Don't kill each other. Um, Diane, you guys are gonna be here on the other side of this first station.00:26:06	T	Cassandra, you guys will be on this side of the first station.00:26:08	T	Carly, you guys will be across from Matt's group. Audrey, you guys will be at this third station over here. Rupert?00:26:16	T	Yes.00:26:17	T	You guys will be just across from that.00:26:22	T	Sheila and Eleanor, you guys will be where Cindy is, working at that station.00:26:26	T	And, Josh and Muriel, you'll be just across from that.00:26:30	T	And- let's see- Andrew and Zeb, you guys will be at this station back here, and you guys will be at the very last station on the end.00:26:37	T	Okay. Let's head to our stations. Take your data table. Let's get them set up and get to work.00:26:42	SN	How much are these worth?00:26:44	T	I think those were worth 50, but-00:26:49	T	is there anything over 50?00:26:52	S	I don't know.00:26:55	T	I think it was just 50, so-00:26:58	S	Okay.00:26:59	T	Go ahead and put 50 on there.00:27:13	T	There are knots in your string other than the one at the end.00:27:17	T	You're gonna want to get those out. They don't go over the pulley well.00:27:22	SN	Are we right here?00:27:23	T	Yep.00:27:24	S	All right.00:27:32	T	You guys are sort of working at different ends here, okay?00:27:36	SN	Like this?00:27:37	T	You probably want to put the loop through. It doesn't- it doesn't really matter.00:27:41	S	Oh.00:27:42	T	But the loop hooks onto the weight. It's just you have to pull a lot more string through if you put the- better bring the string through first.00:27:51	SN	You can't just go like this and then-00:27:53	T	Sure. You can. That's fine.00:27:54	SN	Put that weight up.00:27:58	SN	(You can ask me more, like, gently.)00:28:00	SN	Right here.00:28:01	SN	Where's the weight? This hooks around it?00:28:05	T	Yeah.

Where-?00:28:59	SN	(inaudible) this thing, that we went to yesterday-00:29:02	SN	Okay.00:29:03	SN	'Cause that's what they said to us. They said that-00:29:04	SN	(shall I) measure it?00:29:06	T	She has to measure how far hers went while you're measuring that.00:29:14	SN	Actually, the up-00:29:18	T	Sheila, you're measuring how far your hand moved while she lifted that.00:29:25	T	You want to- you want to start with it on the ground and start at something even, and when she says:00:29:31	T	"Oh, that's 10 centimeters," then you look at how far you went.00:29:36	S	All right.00:29:37	T	Okay?00:29:38	SN	Oh. Is that effort distance?00:29:39	T	So you start- it's how far the effort string goes.

Do we count one, two, three, or these little ones?00:29:48	T	Well, the little ones are what? The big ones are centimeters. What are the little ones?00:29:54	S	Millimeters.00:29:55	T	Okay. They are millimeters, or tenths of a centimeter. So it would be- it would be point something.00:30:00	T	You are trying to measure accurately, yeah. To the tenth would be fine.00:30:13	SN	You're gonna flip it.00:30:15	SN	I'm confused.00:30:17	T	Which one?00:30:18	SN	All right.

Come here.00:38:58	SN	Richard, you're still (inaudible).00:39:01	T	Thanks. You can work right there. That'd be fine.00:39:06	SN	Hopefully we'll never have to use this.00:39:08	T	Yes, except when subs are here.00:39:12	SN	This counts as a homework stamp, right?00:39:15	T	What's that?00:39:16	S	This counts as a homework stamp, right?00:39:17	T	I have no idea why that's on there. What is that on there?00:39:20	SN	Yeah. //I wonder why.00:39:21	T	//Is that the day you couldn't find a blank piece of paper and I stamped that on there for you?00:39:25	SN	No. It's- //I don't know (inaudible)-00:39:26	SN	//Because there are no more-00:39:27	SN	Okay, look at (inaudible). Let's do this.00:39:29	S	Okay, I'm gonna bring it up, //and you measure 10 centimeters off of the table.00:39:30	T	//I don't remember stamping it either. I have no idea what that is.00:39:33	SN	Mr. Melville? Mr. Melville?00:39:34	T	Yeah?00:39:36	T	Andrew, you need to sit down. You need to sit down.00:39:40	SN	Wait. It's not-00:39:41	SN	That's 10 inches, not //centimeters.00:39:43	T	//You guys are seriously gonna want to //get that knot out of there.00:39:44	S	//We need to go inches.00:39:45	T	It really messes up the pulleys.00:39:48	SN	Ten centimeters. //Centimeters!00:39:49	T	//No. No. I said you need to tie a loop to measure effort force, but you don't want any knots in the string. It messes up going through the pulley.00:39:56	S	You have to have your finger right here. Let go.00:39:58	SN	You mean a loop like this, Mr. Melville?00:40:00	T	What's that?00:40:01	SN	Like this?00:40:02	SN	Bridget? What are we weighing?00:40:05	SN	A loop, that circle thing?00:40:06	T	I don't understand what you're saying.00:40:07	SN	Never mind.00:40:11	T	The only time you need a loop in there is when you're measuring the effort force. Other than that, the knot should be out of the string.00:40:18	SN	Understand?00:40:19	SN	Okay.00:40:20	T	Yes?00:40:21	SN	(inaudible)00:40:22	T	That's fine. It has to be enough that you can- well, it should be on the pulley for one.00:40:26	SN	Is Savannah here?00:40:28	SN	Savannah?00:40:30	S	I wasn't looking at that. I was-00:40:31	T	And then you have to pull down to make the weight go up. No, no, no.00:40:35	T	You want to pull down with the scale so you're actually measuring the force on the-00:40:39	S	So like this?00:40:40	T	No.00:40:41	S	You do it. I don't understand-00:40:42	T	There. There. That's it. Now pull down on the scale.00:40:45	SN	On the scale?00:40:46	T	On the scale. Let go of the other string. There you go. That's it.00:40:51	SN	But then you would be looking at it-00:40:53	T	Yes. You're gonna be looking at it upside down.00:40:55	SN	I was, like, like four and a half.00:40:56	SN	I get what you-00:40:57	T	There you go. Yeah. Now, untie it when you're done.00:41:00	SN	Four and a half?00:41:01	SN	So I go like this, right?00:41:02	SN	Where's my pen?00:41:03	T	Yes. But you want to do it straight down, because if you do it at an angle, it gives you a slightly different reading.00:41:08	SN	Six Newtons.00:41:11	SN	Course.00:41:13	SN	Six Newtons.00:41:14	SN	Six?00:41:15	SN	Yeah.00:41:17	SN	Why do you tie that around?00:41:20	SN	What do you need to do for this?00:41:22	T	You need to tie your string at the top, attach your weight directly to the pulley with this little loop of string that I put up here.00:41:31	T	And then you need to run your string through the pulley and up, and you'll be lifting in an upward direction for that one.00:41:39	SN	You didn't see the pulley. Lift the (rope).00:41:42	T	Yes, ma'am.00:41:43	SN	Yes, ma'am?00:41:44	T	I said, "Yes, ma'am."00:41:45	SN	Oh. I see. I see. Wait. No. Wait. No. No. Not that. We already pushed that.00:41:49	T	Yes, ma'am?00:41:50	SN	Mr. Melville, //my loop isn't very good.00:41:51	SN	//(inaudible) and it's 38 centimeters. Where do you put it? I forgot.00:41:55	T	What's 38 centimeters?00:41:57	S	The (inaudible). This.00:41:58	T	No. No, no, no. It's not- it's how far you moved it.00:42:02	S	Yes, I did.00:42:03	T	No. It's how far you moved it in raising it 10 centimeters. So start somewhere even like 50.00:42:10	T	Marcello? Measure the weight. Measure the weight and tell me when it's 10 centimeters off the ground.00:42:18	SN	How do you tie a knot?00:42:19	SN	There.00:42:20	T	Right there?00:42:21	SN	Yeah.00:42:22	T	Okay. I'm at 60 now. Where did I start?00:42:23	S	50.00:42:24	T	I started at 50 so how far did I pull up?00:42:25	S	Ten centimeters.00:42:26	T	There you go. That's what goes in this first spot.00:42:29	T	The distance that you moved //the effort string.00:42:31	SN	//The effort distance?00:42:32	T	The effort distance, yeah.00:42:34	T	Yes?00:42:35	SN	We did- we already did this one. How do we do this?00:42:40	T	You're gonna tie- tie your string to the top. Actually, you can just loop it through, around.00:42:47	T	It's gonna go down, through the pulley. The pulley will be attached with this little loop directly to your weight.00:42:54	SN	No.00:42:55	SN	I don't get it. Can you show me again?00:42:56	T	No. I- look at the picture. I want you to look at the picture and set it up like the picture.00:43:00	SN	We finished all those (inaudible)-00:43:01	T	You finished all four of them?00:43:03	SN	Not all four-00:43:04	T	or you finished the first and second?00:43:06	T	Can I see your data?00:43:12	T	Is it the last one, Zeb?00:43:16	T	You guys were able to get the first and second ones done?00:43:20	SN	Who? Us?00:43:21	SN	It's us.00:43:22	T	Oh, it's you guys.00:43:24	SN	What did you do?00:43:27	S	Look at this.00:43:29	T	The effort force was 16 Newtons?00:43:36	SN	Sixteen... oh, 16 centimeters.00:43:39	T	Okay. That would be effort distance.00:43:41	S	Oh.00:43:43	SN	Okay, we can go on.00:43:44	T	Okay. The resistance force, how did the weight get- your weight was three Newtons both times?00:43:51	T	Which weight do you guys have? Oh. You guys have the brown one, right?00:43:53	SN	Yeah.00:43:54	T	Okay. So that one's different.00:43:55	T	Okay, the one thing you didn't do then on- on, uh, either of these setups is correctly figure out the effort force.00:44:04	T	That's the one where you tie a knot in the string,00:44:06	S	//Oh yeah, we got to do (this)00:44:07	T	//hook the scale up to it and pull.00:44:10	SN	We did it on this one, and we got 12.00:44:11	T	No, you didn't.00:44:17	T	And does that say 16 also? Okay. That one's not right either.00:44:21	T	When you lift this off the ground by 10 centimeters- Miguel, stop it.00:44:30	T	When you lift it off the ground by 10 centimeters, how far did this string move? That's what you need to measure.00:44:35	SN	Oh. Okay.00:44:37	T	Okay? I don't think you did it right either place.00:44:40	S	This is hard. We need Will in here. He's a smart boy.00:44:44	S	You took my stool.00:44:45	T	When you get it set up again, call me over. I'll //show you.00:44:48	S	//All right.00:44:50	T	Yeah?00:44:51	SN	Can you help us with part two?00:44:52	SN	Yeah.00:44:53	T	Okay. Whatcha stuck on?00:44:55	SN	We don't know how to do this thing. We're not-00:44:56	T	Okay. Well, look at it. Your string should be tied to the top bar. Do you see that in the picture?00:45:05	T	Well, you- you can loop it through just like you-00:45:09	S	Oh no, well look.00:45:12	T	Here, I'll give you one hint. Hand me the other end.00:45:20	T	Oh, (it will) slide through.00:45:21	SN	Oh.00:45:28	SN	It's the same.00:45:33	T	Then you hook the pulley directly up to the weight like it shows, run the string through the pulley.00:45:38	T	That little loop of string- yeah. That's how you do that part. Ian, you gonna do anything today?00:45:43	SN	I already-00:45:44	SN	I already did one.00:45:46	SN	I did practically everything.00:45:49	T	//Oh, thank you.00:45:50	SN	//How do you do this part?00:45:51	T	Can I actually look at it where I can see it.00:45:52	SN	How do you do mechanical advantage?00:45:55	T	We're gonna do that one together. What //was-00:45:57	SN	//(We got) 25.00:45:58	T	What was 25?00:45:59	SN	That's what I told her.00:46:00	SN	Where does it say 25?00:46:02	T	On 23 or whatever that says. What is that?00:46:05	S	That says 23.00:46:06	T	So where did that come from? Did //you just make that up?00:46:07	S	//You take 12, six- oh, wait. I forgot to add 10, huh? Okay. It's- it's 33.00:46:12	T	Why?00:46:13	S	Because I added it all up.00:46:15	T	Why?00:46:16	SN	Watch out.00:46:17	SN	Why not?00:46:18	SN	Oh, so for this one we have to do-00:46:19	T	Why?00:46:20	SN	I don't know.00:46:21	T	It doesn't make any sense.00:46:22	S	Well, I don't know how else to do it. That's why.00:46:24	SN	How do you do this part? The one where you put that-00:46:28	SN	You broke it.00:46:30	SN	No, I didn't.00:46:31	T	That's your effort force. You just pull that one down.00:46:33	S	This?00:46:34	T	Yep.00:46:35	SN	Look it, Mr. Melville. We did it.00:46:36	T	Don, that's it. Perfect. Excellent job.00:46:38	T	Okay, folks. It's time to clean up.00:46:41	T	You get out of here when your stations look exactly like they did when you came //to the station,00:46:46	SN	//Hurry up, hurry up, hurry up.00:46:48	T	So everything hung back neatly where it belongs.00:46:52	SN	That was like this.00:46:53	SN	And, uh- oh, can I have that (inaudible)?00:46:56	T	//After school.00:46:57	SN	//Mr. Melville-00:47:02	SN	You think someone can pick up our notebook?00:47:04	T	You're scaring me, Rosalie.00:47:06	SN	Uh, Diane dropped her pencil down the drain.00:47:09	T	You did? Seriously? I have no way of getting it out.00:47:13	S	No one-00:47:14	T	It goes down- it goes down about six inches before-00:47:16	S	No one must see that book. Nobody.00:47:19	T	How about I read the whole thing between now and sixth-00:47:22	S	Don't do it.00:47:24	T	Just to remember. You come after school and you can have it.00:47:25	SN	Okay.00:47:26	T	Yes?00:47:27	SN	Um, what we're doing is we're trying to find the, um-00:47:30	T	//That looks perfect.00:47:31	S	//resistance from the lift, //10 centimeters?00:47:32	T	//Yes.00:47:33	S	But how do you calculate the effort force?00:47:35	T	Tie a knot in the string. Hook the scale through it and pull. Read what you get on the scale.00:47:41	S	Oh. Okay. And- and we weigh- we already weighed it. It weighs five and a half Newtons.00:47:45	T	That's what- that's the force the gravity is pulling downward with.00:47:48	S	So resist-00:47:49	T	That's correct. That's the resistance force.00:47:50	S	And after that we just cut-00:47:52	T	No. Don't worry about that yet. We're gonna do that together.00:47:54	S	Okay. And it's the same thing here if we were to do it?00:47:57	T	Exactly. It's just a different pulley setup, but the calculations are the same.00:48:01	S	Oh. Okay.00:48:04	T	I thought I told you guys that yesterday.00:48:06	SN	You said Friday.00:48:07	T	Right. Tomorrow's Friday. That's cool.00:48:12	T	Folks, seriously, your stations need disassembled, cleaned up, put back the way they were.00:48:18	T	I don't see a single station that's acceptable right now.00:48:22	SN	That one is.00:48:23	SN	Look at ours.00:48:24	SN	Ours.00:48:27	T	You guys don't get to go until the station looks like it did when you got there.00:48:34	SN	Are you serious?00:48:35	T	Serious.00:48:36	SN	That's how it looked when I got there.00:48:37	T	That looks good.00:48:38	S	I know, huh.00:48:41	T	Everything neatly hung up on those corners like it was when you got there.00:48:46	T	Rulers lined up neatly on the table. No knots in the string. Please get them cleaned up.00:48:58	SN	We couldn't get the pencil out of the drain.00:49:00	T	No. You won't probably be able to. I'm sure there's probably many, many things down the drain.00:49:08	T	You probably wouldn't want your pencil back after it'd been down the drain anyways. It's kind of nasty.00:49:13	SN	Does this go in the closet?00:49:18	SN	(Would you) get my pencil out?00:49:19	SN	No.00:49:21	SN	I think it went all the way down the drain, because it's not in there no more, Diane.00:49:26	T	There's a- there's a drain trap so it can't go past.00:49:30	SN	Well, what if we took off that sink part and like-00:49:33	T	Well, we could. You just need a screwdriver and, uh, you need some pipe tape so when you put it back so that it seals again,00:49:44	T	and you could rescal- rescue her mangy old pencil.00:49:48	T	You need it desperately?00:49:49	SN	Uh-huh.00:49:50	T	Yes?00:49:53	SN	Excuse me, //Mr. Melville?00:49:54	T	//Hey, folks. Let's stand up and get your chairs pushed under, please.00:50:17	SS	Shh.00:50:19	SN	(inaudible)00:50:20	T	Just push it under, but you don't get to go until anybody else goes. Okay, Andrew?00:50:27	T	Punch and munch tomorrow, not punch and munch and movie. Just punch and munch. You do have a quiz tomorrow.00:50:32	T	You might want to look over some of the stuff we've talked about this week like work and machines-00:50:38	SN	What can we bring again?00:50:39	T	Anything except for gum, corn nuts, sunflower seeds and chips. Anything else is fair game.00:50:43	T	All right. I need Miguel, Matt, Ian, and Audrey. They owe me two minutes. The rest of you may go.00:50:48	SN	What did I do-00:50:49	T	Miguel, you owe me 15 minutes at lunch, tomorrow.00:50:52	T	Expect to see you then.00:50:55	SN	What did I do to get that-               Bottom of Form
