Top of Form00:00:00	S	I got to remember, I'm writing a petition. Second hour should be (inaudible). 00:00:04	T	Okay. The bells are kind of messed up so we will- I will probably just go ahead and dismiss you. We're now starting like five minutes late,00:00:15	T	because they didn't get the bells working right.00:00:16	T	All right, who is absent? Anybody?00:00:19	SN	I don't know.00:00:21	T	You don't know? Do you know who sits at your table normally?00:00:25	SN	//He's missing. Who is he?00:00:26	SN	//I don't know who is supposed to-00:00:27	SN	Devin is not here.00:00:28	SN	No. He's //here.00:00:29	T	//Devin is gone.00:00:30	S	He's here.00:00:31	T	Right. He's here.00:00:35	T	Jennifer, I'm gonna have you move to-00:00:41	T	Yeah, a table of three people, not the one that's got four. 00:00:46	T	All right, so nobody is absent? Everybody is here?00:00:49	SN	Yeah.00:00:52	T	Okay. 00:00:57	T	Um, I'm not going to return your papers today. I'll save that for tomorrow. We'll get right into what we're going to be talking about today. 00:01:06	T	There's just a couple of things that I needed to go over with you first that I'm not sure that you got it before. 00:01:16	T	Yes? Writing your homework books? Okay. 00:01:24	T	All right. Open up your book. What? 00:01:28	SN	I can't hear out of my ear.00:01:30	T	What's wrong?00:01:31	S	It hurts.00:01:33	T	Did you ever go to the doctor?00:01:35	S	Yeah.00:01:36	SN	Miss A, (inaudible).00:01:37	T	What?00:01:38	SN	(inaudible).00:01:39	T	Okay. Take these right here. Go. Bye. They must feel like they have the plague or something.00:01:48	T	All right. You ready?00:01:50	SN	Yeah.00:01:51	T	Okay. On page- open your book to page 588. 00:01:54	T	There are- 00:02:03	T	There are some weather maps. There's actually four weather maps on those pages that are in front of you. 00:02:08	T	They are showing a progression of weather over a four-day period? Three-day period, okay. Where the weather is going. 00:02:19	T	Looking at those four maps, looking at the one on the page before that- flip one page back- 00:02:31	T	Okay? And looking on the page after that- flip two pages, forward- 00:02:40	T	So you're looking at page 587, 88, 89, and 90- find the high pressure centers; 00:02:55	T	find the low pressure centers,00:03:00	T	on any one of those five or six maps,00:03:04	T	find the cold fronts and the warm fronts. 00:03:10	T	Okay, now here's a puzzle for you. What do you notice about fronts and pressure centers?00:03:18	T	What do you notice about the fronts and the high pressure; and the fronts and the low pressure?00:03:24	T	Look- and you gotta look at the map in order to answer the question.00:03:29	T	And if you can't figure it out with one map, move to another map.00:03:35	T	Make some comparisons.00:03:38	T	What pattern do you notice about fronts and pressure centers?00:03:53	SN	I have a question.00:03:54	T	Mm. No- no, no. I'm waiting.00:03:58	SN	I have a question.00:03:59	T	Oh. Question? Okay.00:04:00	S	Aren't the pointed ones the warm fronts?00:04:03	T	The pointed ones are the cold fronts.00:04:05	S	Okay. I was just making sure.00:04:10	T	I thought you were gonna answer the question. I am waiting for some people to get that look on their face, like, "oh." 00:04:22	T	Stuart, are you noticing anything?00:04:28	T	Is there something you're noticing about the high pressure centers that is not the same as the low pressure centers?00:04:41	SN	Besides the- besides the points?00:04:44	T	Besides the what?00:04:45	S	The points, the triangle-00:04:46	T	What about the points?00:04:48	S	That there's like more(inaudible)-00:04:51	T	There's no triangles where?00:04:53	S	No. There's more triangles-00:04:54	T	Oh.00:04:55	S	Than there's (inaudible).00:04:57	T	Oh. Okay. So there's more cold fronts than warm fronts?00:05:00	S	Yeah.00:05:00	T	Okay, but what about the low pressure centers and what about the high pressure centers? 00:05:15	T	Mitch, what do you think?00:05:16	SN	I think that there's low pressure centers on the cold fronts and the warm fronts too. Like on a front //there's like a-00:05:23	T	//And what about the high pressure centers?00:05:25	S	They are moving away from the front.00:05:28	T	They don't seem to have fronts attached to them, do they?00:05:32	S	No.00:05:33	T	You notice that, Jeff?00:05:34	SN	Uh-huh.00:05:35	T	Look at all the low pressure centers. Do you see fronts attached to them? 00:05:39	T	No. Can you tell me why? Remember the balloon thing? Can you tell me why? Jeff, what do you think?00:05:49	S	Uh, when it hits the hot air, it would like go above it. Like-00:05:56	T	So you got a warm air mass and a cold air mass?00:05:58	S	Yes. And when it hits- I remember, but- I remember it, but it's hard to explain.00:06:05	T	Okay. You're saying the warm air rises above that cold air?00:06:09	S	Yes. 00:06:10	T	Okay. 00:06:11	S	And the-00:06:14	T	And the warm air has what kind of pressure?00:06:18	S	Low pressure.00:06:19	T	Okay. Mark, did you have something to add?00:06:21	SN	No. I was gonna say (inaudible).00:06:24	T	Okay. Let me show you a real easy way to really kind of understand it. I have three balloons this time, and they are different color. Red is?00:06:34	SN	Cold.00:06:35	SS	Warm.00:06:36	T	Warm air. Blue is?00:06:37	SS	Cold.00:06:38	T	Cold, and yellow is?00:06:39	SS	Warm.00:06:40	T	Is cooler. Let's say cooler. All right. Let's look up here for a second. 00:06:47	T	And you'll even notice on this map there aren't any fronts attached to those low pressure centers, right? 00:06:52	T	Just- or to the high pressure centers. Just to the low pressure centers, right? 00:06:56	SN	Uh-huh.00:06:57	T	Okay. So where would the red balloon go? If this is the- what kind of front?00:07:03	SS	Cold.00:07:04	SN	Cold front.00:07:05	T	Then where's the warm air going to be?00:07:07	SS	Going behind it.00:07:08	T	Behind it? This is the front of a warm air mass?00:07:12	SN	Uh, no. It's gonna be in front of it.00:07:13	T	It's gonna be in front of it?00:07:14	SN	Yeah.00:07:15	T	Okay. Where's the cold air gonna be?00:07:17	E	Behind it.00:07:18	T	Behind it. And we'll put the yellow air up here, okay? This is where the low pressure center happens. Watch what happens. 00:07:25	T	Here's the warm air. Here's the cold air. Here's the cool air. You see the hole in between the three?00:07:31	E	Yeah.00:07:32	T	There's your low pressure center. It's where those big bubbles of air have a depression, or an area, a gap, that space, 00:07:42	T	that's the low. See? Yeah.00:07:45	SS	Yeah. 00:07:46	T	Ah. Okay? That's what you're looking at. You're looking at that bubble of warm air, the bubble of cold air behind. 00:07:53	T	Here's the front right here, right? The front of the air mass, yes? 00:07:57	T	And then where they all meet up- where these bubbles of air meet up, that's where that low pressure center comes in. 00:08:04	T	The high pressure is going to be this big bubble of cold air at the very highest point of it as far as pressure goes. 00:08:14	T	It's not gonna ever have a front because it occurs in like the middle of the air mass, okay? 00:08:20	SN	Okay.00:08:21	T	Get it?00:08:22	SN	Yeah.00:08:23	T	Ooh. Yes?00:08:24	SN	So then basically a tornado would be caused because of low pressure in the (inaudible)?00:08:30	T	Yes. That depression of low pressure air, right. What you got is air funneling in and air funneling up at the same time, 00:08:39	T	and then once it starts to twist- when we see that video on "Understanding Weather," 00:08:43	T	it's really cool because it shows the air funneling like this on the ground. What's that called?00:08:51	SN	Conven- 00:08:52	SN	Convection current.00:08:53	T	Right. It shows that on the ground like a big tube doing that, and then when that- I think it showed cold air- hits it- excuse me- hits it, 00:09:03	T	it- remember when I said the cold air hits that blue and the blue goes flying off- or the-00:09:08	SN	Uh-huh.00:09:09	T	Cold air hits the red and the warm air goes flying up? That's what causes the storm? 00:09:13	T	What it shows is that that tube gets split and splits up this way, and that's the beginning of a funnel cloud. It's very cool. 00:09:22	T	But you'll see that on the, uh, video. Okay. So does that help with low pressure and high pressure and-00:09:28	SN	Yeah.00:09:29	SN	//Yeah.00:09:30	T	//Okay? Kind of a visual.00:09:31	SN	Uh-huh.00:09:32	T	Okay. The reason you need to know that is because this is what you are going to be doing. 00:09:36	T	First hour did not even finish the cities on their map which was kind of disappointing. I thought they'd get further than that. 00:09:44	T	You do not need- and I won't let you use- your book or your notes. I was going to let you, and then I thought, 00:09:52	T	"No, I think that you need to get that station model plugged into your head a little better than you have it." 00:09:58	T	Okay? So you don't need any of that. You may use the map on page 770, I think. Check page 770 in your book. 00:10:13	T	There should be, yep, a map of the United States. You also have a map like this at your table with all of the cities on it. 00:10:21	T	Oh. They don't have one down there. 00:10:23	T	Hannah, would- would you take that map down to the office and ask them to give it to the kids inside the conference room?00:10:32	SN	Okay.00:10:33	T	Okay? I think they brought the map back from their- and then tell them to leave it there. Leave the pencils and the map, okay?00:10:40	T	All right, so you've got enough reference for finding certain cities. You're going to get a list of 12 cities in the United States.00:10:48	T	Oh, that stays on; this goes off.00:10:49	T	A list of 12 cities in the United States, with some other data. I told you this last week.00:10:56	T	And you're going to get a blank map that- handing out?00:11:02	SN	(inaudible)00:11:03	T	Okay. Handing out?00:11:06	SN	Here. (inaudible)00:11:07	T	Yeah. Dorothy.00:11:08	T	I want to let Dorothy do it, because she threw her hand out there first. I didn't think she wanted to get up, but she does.00:11:14	T	Okay. You're gonna get a sheet like this, that has all of the instructions that you need on it.00:11:19	T	What you are going to do is, on the map, in front of you- and put all your notes away right now-00:11:25	T	any notes, any... You can only have your book open at page 770.00:11:45	T	Okay. On the blue sheet is a list of the 12 cities, around the country. You might wanna make note that-00:11:55	T	Hatteras, fourth from the bottom, is actually called "Cape Hatteras"; 00:12:02	T	most of you have probably never heard of it. You will, though, by the time we get done with oceans.00:12:07	T	It is in North Carolina. North Carolina.00:12:13	T	I'm not gonna show you where that is; you ought to know where North Carolina is.00:12:17	T	And, uh, Kansas City. There are two big Kansas Cities. We're talking about- thank you- Kansas City, Missouri. Okay?00:12:26	T	So you might wanna write "MO" after Kansas City, just so you remember where it's from.00:12:39	T	All right, who wants to read the directions? I'm gonna stop you a lot as you go through, and explain certain things.00:12:44	T	Mark, go ahead.00:12:45	SN	"Locate and label each of the above cities on the attachment."00:12:49	T	Okay. The first thing you're going to do is find the cities, one at the time. Detroit, okay?00:12:55	T	When you find it on the map, you're gonna put the little dot where Detroit goes.00:13:02	T	Then you're gonna write "Detroit," but you've got to write small, and you've got to write neat, so that I can read it. 00:13:09	T	Stuart, you haven't started yet, have you?00:13:10	SN	No.00:13:11	T	Don't, because I- I've got to tell you the whole thing. 00:13:15	T	Remember where Detroit goes on a station- a weather station model, right? 00:13:22	T	Many of you forgot to put "Weather City" when you had to redo another station model on that worksheet. 00:13:28	T	Lots of people did not put that city name. They put all the other stuff but didn't put the city. 00:13:33	T	So when you write "Detroit," to the left of it make your circle right away and start building that station model.00:13:43	T	Otherwise, if you go through and write all the cities first, then you're gonna have to go back and make sure you've got room to put the station model. 00:13:51	T	So do one city at a time, okay? Do you know what I'm saying? 00:13:54	SN	Uh-huh.00:13:55	T	You got it? Yes?00:13:56	SN	(inaudible)?00:13:57	T	Like this. I'll just start this first one just so you know. 00:14:00	T	If you have got this part of Michigan right here, and you put the dot, you need to write "Detroit" over here, okay? 00:14:11	T	And then start your station model right here.00:14:15	T	All right? A reminder that the wind direction is that arrow to the middle.00:14:22	T	All right? And- I'm trying to think what else they had trouble with. They had a little trouble last hour with cloud coverage in the circle. 00:14:32	T	If you're not sure, ask someone at your table first before I come around to help you with that. Make sure you get it before- 00:14:38	T	or somebody else- you've asked somebody else before you ask me, okay? 00:14:43	T	Because you had the 25%, you had the 50%, and you had the 75% then you had full coverage. 00:14:48	T	Remember what those meant because that's how they are on this sheet, okay? Okay. So there's your- any questions on the station model? 00:14:59	T	You know where everything goes on there? There are only two cities with current conditions, and I'll put the symbols on the board. 00:15:04	T	They're very simple, okay? So you don't need that chart either. Okay. Next one. Mark, keep going.00:15:12	SN	"Construct a weather station map for each of the above cities. Place them at approximate locations."00:15:18	T	Appropriate locations. 00:15:20	S	//Oh.00:15:21	T	//Yep. All right. Now, that's as far as everybody got for second hour, okay? Go ahead and read on, Mark.00:15:28	S	Place high and low pressure centers where you think that- where you think they would be located on the map. 00:15:34	T	You're gonna have to look at what in order to do that? What's some indicators of high and low pressure? 00:15:42	T	Oh, no. You know what we thought of last hour? Don't do this one. Put an arrow, four, five, and five to four. 00:15:49	T	Do step five first. It'll make four a lot easier. Or three and four. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Wait, wait, wait. 00:15:56	T	Do step four first and then go back up and do step three. Read step four, Mark, so I can explain what I mean there.00:16:06	S	Shade regions of precipitation. Place symbol for cold and warm fronts where they would most- most likely be located on the map.00:16:16	T	Okay. Do you see why I said to do this one first?00:16:19	SN	Uh-huh.00:16:20	T	When you find the areas of precipitation and then you find the cold and warm fronts, 00:16:25	T	it should be a lot easier to put the low pressure and high pressure centers, right? Okay. 00:16:30	T	So do number four first and then go back and do number three. When you shade for precipitation: 00:16:39	T	if it's light rain, it's a light green; if it's medium rain, if they just say rain, then it's a yellow; and if it's a thunderstorm, then it's red. 00:16:49	T	That's how the Doppler Radar satellite picture picks it up, okay? It's the density of the air is what they pick up, all right?00:16:57	T	Okay. Go ahead, Mark.00:16:59	SN	Answer the following questions. Interpret the data using your (map weather). 00:17:05	S	Explain the locations of high and low pressure centers in warm and cool fronts. 00:17:11	S	Are there any environmental or severe weather incidents that may occur? Include the weather indications in the map. 00:17:20	S	Use your weather map to explain the above answer.00:17:24	T	Okay. This will be on a separate sheet of paper- probably won't get it until about the middle of class tomorrow-00:17:30	T	where now you have to explain why you put everything on your map where you put it, okay? 00:17:36	T	So you're kind of explaining yourself: low pressure, high pressure. And hopefully you'll be able to do that. 00:17:42	T	I think you can, if you allow yourself to think in that direction. Okay, and then six.00:17:50	S	"Using the data on the weather, forecast the weather for October 24th, 2002, for each of the cities of the (inaudible)-00:17:58	T	Okay. Are there any questions about what I expect you to do? No? 00:18:06	T	So I will be able to just sit here the whole time you're doing this and just watch you like last hour? Todd?00:18:15	SN	I don't get "shade regions of precipitation."00:18:19	T	Okay. On the map that you had to do for the weather station models, they told you to shade the areas of precipitation. 00:18:26	T	The same way that this map did- you see how they shaded these areas? Where it's raining. 00:18:34	T	And once you get done with all your station models, you'll be able to see it better. 00:18:37	T	You'll look for the cloudy areas, and then from that you'll look for the rainy areas.00:18:40	S	Now I know, I just- I thought you meant to do four completely first.00:18:46	T	No. No. Well, yeah. You're gonna do four first before you do three.00:18:50	S	I know that, but I thought-00:18:51	T	Oh, no. Not before two though, right. Okay. Got ya.00:18:54	T	Jeff?00:18:55	SN	Do you work as a group or-00:18:56	T	You work as a group, yes.00:18:57	S	Okay.00:18:58	T	Which means talking quietly about the mapping activity, not about what you did over the weekend, okay?00:19:07	T	Yes, Wes?00:19:08	SN	I'm really not sure about these, uh, models we have to put down.00:19:13	T	Okay.00:19:14	S	I don't quite understand them.00:19:15	T	Did you do that worksheet last week?00:19:17	S	Which one?00:19:18	T	The one that you were supposed to turn in for a grade on Friday. 00:19:21	S	I'm not sure.00:19:22	T	You had "weather city" and then "around the circle" which had cloudiness in it.00:19:30	S	I don't remember anything like that. I remember most of last week.00:19:34	T	All right, I'm not sure you turned it in. 00:19:36	S	I'm not sure either.00:19:37	T	Okay. We'll see what your group can help you with.00:19:41	S	Okay.00:19:43	T	Jeff?00:19:44	SN	I was wondering if I could move right next to Geoffrey so we-00:19:47	T	Sure. Mark?00:19:49	SN	When we're like doing Detroit, you said- do you want us to write- 00:19:52	S	like go through and write all the cities and then go and do the weather stations, or do the city and then the weather station?00:19:58	T	Somebody want to answer Mark's question?00:20:01	SN	Do the weather- the city and the weather station together.00:20:03	SN	Okay.00:20:05	T	Don't go- don't do all the cities first and then go back and do the stations because you might write the name of the city in the wrong place,00:20:12	T	and you won't be able to fit the weather station around it. Hannah?00:20:15	SN	Okay. What do we do for, like, the current conditions?00:20:21	T	Okay. There are only two. Thanks for that. There are only two. Let me pull this up. 00:20:28	T	They call it on those dir- and that's actual data information from last Wednesday, the 23rd, straight off the Weather Channel. 00:20:37	T	When you're all done, I'm going to give you the actual satellite map with the warm fronts and cold fronts and high and low pressures. 00:20:44	T	You're gonna compare that to what you came up with on your map. I'm looking at probably Wednesday by the time we get to that. 00:20:53	T	Then you're- you're gonna forecast at the bottom. Your last step is gonna be a forecast. 00:20:57	T	Then you're gonna look at what happened the next day and see how well your forecast came out, okay? 00:21:02	T	Uh, but on the Weather Channel, instead of calling it intermittent rain, they call it light rain. So this is the symbol for light rain. 00:21:11	T	I know it's tough, and I don't know if you're gonna be able to remember it, but that's light rain, okay? 00:21:18	T	There are no thunderstorms, none of that, all the fancy stuff they had on that chart. And guess what this is?00:21:24	SS	Snow.00:21:25	T	Light snow. 00:21:27	T	If it were heavy snow, there would be two of them. Oops. Okay? 00:21:35	T	Any other questions? Yes, Wes?00:21:39	SN	So if it was heavy rain, there would be two //little footnotes?00:21:42	T	//Two dots, yep. Yep.00:21:45	SN	Can I have a pencil? I only brought a pen.00:21:48	T	Yeah. If you need a pencil, let me know. Don't try to do this in pen. It's too- too much erasing going on. 00:21:54	T	Yes, Mitch? Question?00:21:57	SN	When we shade these, what colors did they- do you want us to have them?00:22:01	T	I have a box of pencils right up- colored pencils. I did. Right up here. Whatever color you want except red or blue. 00:22:09	T	Oops. You needed this. 00:22:12	T	Whatever color you want except red or blue, okay? All right. If there are no more questions, get started. 00:22:21	T	I'm gonna put this away so I don't trip on it. 00:22:29	T	Yes?00:22:30	SN	I need a pencil.00:22:31	T	Okay. Go back over there and get one from where I got it, top- that little top drawer. Mark, did you have a question?00:22:37	SN	I don't like sitting next to a wall.00:22:39	SN	(inaudible)00:22:40	T	Why?00:22:41	SN	(inaudible)00:22:44	T	On the wall? Do you want me to move you up here? 00:22:48	S	No, that's all right.00:22:49	T	Oh. I thought so. Christina?00:22:51	SN	Can I sharpen my pencil?00:22:52	T	Yes, you may sharpen your pencil.00:22:54	SN	Can I sharpen my pencil, too?00:22:56	T	Yeah. You guys are supposed to do this beforehand. 00:23:06	T	Okay. Let's see if I can talk you through this. You wrote "the city of Detroit." 00:23:11	T	And then there was a circle next to it so just draw a circle, a relatively large circle. 00:23:20	T	Okay. Now- no. Don't fill it in. Just a //circle.00:23:21	SN	//Oh.00:23:23	T	And I just said "use a pencil." Is that a pencil?00:23:25	S	Yes.00:23:26	T	Oh. That's a cool pencil. Okay. An open circle. Now, in the circle you have four choices. 00:23:37	T	These are your choices: mostly sunny- no. Clear, mostly sunny, partly cloudy, mostly cloudy, cloudy. That's it. Five of them. Okay? 00:23:49	S	That would be cloudy, wouldn't it?00:23:50	T	And they are- it's saying cloudy. And they are represented by how much you shade that circle. 00:23:57	S	So that would be about 50% probably?00:23:58	T	Actually, cloudy is gonna be all shaded. 00:24:01	S	Okay.00:24:02	T	Okay? 00:24:04	T	And let me see your pencil for a minute, and I'll draw them on the back so you can- all right. 00:24:09	T	This one is totally unshaded so that's going to be what?00:24:14	S	Uh, sunny. 00:24:15	T	Clear. Yeah. Sunny or clear. This one is gonna be a quarter shaded. 00:24:20	T	This one is gonna be- let's do them all first and then you can compare. This one is gonna be this way. 00:24:29	T	And that one is gonna be completely- and you know this one's cloudy and this one's clear. 00:24:33	T	Okay? So now your other options are mostly cloudy, mostly sunny or partly cloudy.00:24:41	S	Okay. So that would be sunny, partly- that would be sunny, that would be partly cloudy, mostly cloudy, right? No. No.00:24:53	T	Okay. If-00:24:54	S	//Oh, boy.00:24:55	T	//That's all right. Relax. If that's clear, then this is like mostly clear or mostly?00:25:01	S 	Mostly clear.00:25:03	T	Mostly clear or mostly? If this one's sunny- 00:25:08	S	Mostly sunny.00:25:09	T	Okay. This one is mostly sunny. Now you've got mostly cloudy and partly cloudy and these two left. 00:25:17	T	Which one's mostly cloudy and which one's partly cloudy? What's that one?00:25:22	S	Mostly cloudy.00:25:23	T	What's that one?00:25:24	S	Partly cloudy.00:25:25	T	Okay. So you've got-00:25:27	S	Sunny, clear.00:25:29	T	Yeah. Sunny or clear.00:25:30	S	Mostly sunny, partly cloudy, mostly cloudy, cloudy.00:25:36	T	Beautiful.00:25:37	T	Detroit was easy, but you're gonna get to some other ones that- okay? 00:25:42	T	All right, now, the next thing that you have to figure out is where the temperature goes and where the dew point goes. 00:25:47	T	You guys, you have humidity information. Does it go on the weather station model anywhere?00:25:53	SN	No.00:25:55	SS	No.00:25:56	T	No. We didn't put humidity on there, did we?00:25:58	S	So I don't need-00:25:59	SN	(inaudible)00:26:00	T	Well, just- you don't need it right now. You'll need it to answer some questions, but you don't need it on the weather station model. Mark?00:26:06	SN	For Detroit how is eight mile an hour- (you got us around 10).00:26:09	T	Eight-mile-an-hour wind- I told you last week, your choice. It's either a five- you listening, Geoffrey? 00:26:17	T	Eight-mile-an-hour wind is either a five or a 10. Your choice. 00:26:21	T	If you show me three long lines there, I'm gonna know you didn't know what you were doing, okay? All right. 00:26:28	T	Do you remember where temperature went? 00:26:35	SN	Right above it. 00:26:36	T	Yeah. Right above it to the left. 00:26:44	T	Okay. And then dew point went? 00:26:47	S	Upper right a bit?00:26:49	T	Below left. 00:26:56	T	Okay? You've got the city there. Do you remember what goes above the city on this thing?00:27:03	S	The pressure?00:27:04	T	Yep. 00:27:05	SN	Then we do- write on the left.00:27:09	SN	Pressure is on the left.00:27:14	T	When you do the pressure, make sure you show falling, steady or rising, either with the letters or the arrows. 00:27:20	T	Rising would be just shooting straight across, a horizontal line. 00:27:27	T	Okay. So, now, if you're not doing humidity, the only thing you have left is wind speed and direction. Do you remember how that was represented? 00:27:34	S	Um, (by an arrow).00:27:36	T	Huh?00:27:37	S	By an arrow.00:27:38	T	An arrow that's shooting into the circle.00:27:40	S	Right.00:27:41	T	And it is a //northeast wind, so- 00:27:42	S	//North... in this area down here?

Before you start one?00:29:54	T	I mean, that's what I would do. I guess you can do it any way you want, but- I guess everybody else is doing it that way, too.00:30:04	T	Remember to keep your handwriting very small and really nice and neat, those of you that struggle with neat. Really nice and neat.00:30:15	SN	That good?00:30:17	SN 	There's a river. 00:30:18	T	Yes.00:30:19	SN	Miss A, there's a river through it, but there is no little dot for it.00:30:26	T	How about on the plastic map?

Circle, and you put New York right there. Okay. And keep this- that right there.00:31:15	SN	Can we just put like NC- I mean NY for like New York?00:31:20	T	Yeah. Make sure I'm not- make sure you don't get too much clutter around it so that you can't tell that that's what it is.00:31:25	S	Okay.00:31:26	T	Okay?

A very good question, Jennifer. That was the other one I hadn't answered. Listen, please. 00:39:30	T	One of those has a variable direction which means you're not gonna have an arrow shooting into that circle because they're all over the place. 00:39:38	T	If you don't have the arrow shooting into the circle, then you can't put the what? Five miles per hour?00:39:42	SN	Yeah.00:39:43	T	Okay. So put the line on there anywhere. Because if it's variable, it's changing a whole lot. 00:39:48	T	So just put it anywhere, and then put the five-mile-an-hour line on there. There's another one, though, that says variable-00:39:56	T	Speed.00:39:57	T	speed, so put the arrow for the wind direction and then put a V at the end of it, okay? 00:40:04	T	Because you can't say. It's probably anywhere from three to 15 miles an hour. 00:40:10	T	Okay? Get it?00:40:12	SN	Yeah.00:40:13	T	Okay. Does that help?

How are we supposed to know-00:40:38	T	Nine is closer to what? Nine or- I mean 10 or five?00:40:42	S	It would be ten.00:40:43	T	Okay. So use the 10.00:40:45	S	Okay.00:40:46	T	Okay? And even when you get to the 12- that's halfway between the 10 and the 15- you'll pick.00:40:53	S	Okay.00:40:54	T	Okay?

I'll- to put it to you this way, there's a lighthouse on Cape Hatteras so it can't be back in that cove area, right? 00:48:05	T	It's got to be the most sticking out point of North Carolina. How's that?00:48:11	SN	That's good.00:48:12	T	Okay. But they had to move the lighthouse because the most sticking out point of North Carolina got washed away, and they thought //that they-00:48:20	SN 	//So the original Cape Hatteras is in the ocean.00:48:25	SN	So wait, a continent got washed out to sea?00:48:27	T	Okay, Dorothy. You got me there. 00:48:29	S	I'm confused.00:48:30	T	I can't- no. They actually rolled it back. It's very interesting.00:48:33	S	//What?00:48:34	T	//I'll find the stuff.

When you get to the point when you are ready to do precipitation and the fronts, decide as a group,00:53:23	T	so that you can explain why you think the front needs to go somewhere and then someone else can either debate with you or agree with you. 00:53:30	T	And don't agree with the person just because they get better grades in science.00:53:36	T	Because a lot of times when it comes to this kind of stuff they won't get it. It happens an awful lot. 00:53:43	T	They know the bookwork, they understand some of the concepts, but when it comes to actually applying them,00:53:49	T	sometimes those people that really get good grades have a real hard time with this kind of stuff.

If you want to get out at the bell, it probably won't ring until a quarter after or so. 00:54:15	SN	Oh. The bells are behind?00:54:16	T	The bells are behind.
