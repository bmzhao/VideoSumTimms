What is it?00:31:35	SN	CaO.00:31:36	T	CaO. You've had geology, earlier today. Correct?00:31:39	SN	Yes.00:31:40	T	In your previous class. I wanted to ask you, didn't you also learn-00:31:45	SN	Limestone.00:31:46	T	Limestone. And what is created from the limestone?00:31:49	SS	(inaudible).00:31:50	T	The limestone or the karst-like process. Yes? Do you know the main reason for the karst-like process?00:31:58	SN	Sun and... limestone precipitates out.00:32:00	T	Well, limestone precipitates, it creates calcite. And what grows from that? //Stalagmite.00:32:07	SN	//Stalagmite00:32:08	T	Yes. The stalagmite grows from it. What else do we- I brought a sample. I'm sure you've seen it before, but I brought some //limestone here, just in case.00:32:20	SN	//Is it the chalk?00:32:21	T	It is not a chalk. It's the limestone. It's white limestone.
