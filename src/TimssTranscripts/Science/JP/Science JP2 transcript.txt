Top of Form00:00:08	T	Uh, today let's summarize the results of the experiment we did yesterday, such as what happened to iodine and what happened to the Benedict's solution.00:00:20	T	And then, things we understand from these results. On the right side of the report sheet there are two items writte, (1), (2)00:00:27	T	(1) is what is learned from the iodine reaction.00:00:33	T	(2) is what is learned from the Benedict's solution reaction.00:00:37	T	I want you to summarize these two. I want you to discuss it in a group, but, don't form groups yet.00:00:48	T	Uh, based on your results, we will eventually have a class summary.00:00:54	T	Since it will be written down in your notebooks, please write the title of the experiment in your notebook.00:00:59	B	[Name of the experiment: Examination of the Digestive Process Caused by Saliva]00:01:49	T	Now you are going to form groups and discuss, but there is one thing I want to confirm before that.00:01:55	T	That is Benedict's solution. Benedict's solution.00:02:00	T	If we say Benedict's solution, I think you all have it written down in your notebook but, what is it?00:02:07	T	Benedict's solution. Which one is it?00:02:11	T	What is it used for? Makoto. How about you?00:02:15	T	Benedict's solution. What do you think?00:02:17	SN	It's not written in my notebook.00:02:19	T	It's not written in your notebook. I see. How about you, Tsuyoshi?00:02:23	SN	It is used to detect sugar.00:02:25	T	Right. Yes. It is used to detect sugar. What do we do with it, Tsuyoshi?00:02:32	S	Heat it.00:02:33	T	Yes. Heat it. And then? What happens when we can tell that there is sugar?00:02:37	S	It turns red.00:02:38	T	It turns red.00:02:39	SS	[laughter].00:02:40	T	When it turns red. That's all right. It is red anyway.00:02:43	T	The material we used this time was a substance called starch, and the other one which will be detected by the Benedict's solution is sugar, right?00:02:47	B	[Starch]00:02:54	B	[Sugar]00:02:55	T	I would like to touch on these two items just to explain something.00:03:01	T	The substance called starch- in the second year, science division one, which we studied in the first semester.00:03:07	T	All substances are made up of molecules. We talked about things like this, or like this, that are all made up of molecules.00:03:18	T	But starch is- well, starch is also made up of molecules, but the molecules of starch are like this, long molecules, like this. Longer and longer. Long molecules.00:03:34	T	At a glance, starch is a huge thing. The molecules are long. That's how it looks.00:03:41	T	But on the other hand, sugar's molecule is short. Its molecule is short. At a glance, the molecule is small compared to starch.00:03:55	T	When we include these issues in our consideration, the discussion will be easier.00:04:01	T	So, today, you will form groups.00:04:05	T	Uh, this... this needs to be focused... uh... yes.00:04:11	T	This is same as your report sheet.00:04:13	T	Summarize the result of your group, how the iodine reacted from A to D and how the Benedict's solution changed.00:04:25	T	Four of you will summarize the results of groups one, two, three, four, etc. After that, summarize the results.00:04:33	T	(1) What we can study from the iodine reaction; (2) what we can study from the Benedict's solution.00:04:38	T	Four of you, or maybe if you have five people, the five of you think together and summarize it. I will let you present it later.00:04:44	T	All right, I will let you form groups. Go ahead.00:04:58	T	Unless you move it in this way... this one is... oh, like this. That's good. Very good.00:05:15	T	What were the results in this group?00:05:18	SN	I have them written here.00:05:25	T	I see.00:05:45	T	That's good, right? This group is almost all at a good position.00:05:52	T	What can we say from this?00:05:56	T	A and C are... what is this? Black? Iodine does not become black in a reaction.00:06:03	SN	It was blackish, right?00:06:04	SN	//Yeah.00:06:05	T	//Well, blackish-00:06:06	SN	Bluish purple.00:06:07	T	Yes. This is a stage in which the bluish purple is very dark.00:06:09	SN	Dark purple.00:06:10	SN	Teacher.00:06:11	T	Yes.00:06:12	S	Do we write down the things to consider?00:06:13	T	Yes. Think about the things to consider. Think about the things to consider.00:06:16	T	And this part... these are supposed to have starch but... they are pale purple or white. Not white, rather transparent, I think.00:06:27	T	Why did they become like that?00:06:31	T	That's what you should consider.00:06:34	SN	Maybe because it cooled down.00:06:36	T	Tsk. If iodine reaction- it reacts to iodine, does it mean it has starch or not?00:06:42	SN	It has.00:06:43	T	It means it has starch, right? That means, in A and C, there is only starch to begin with, so it is natural that they are bluish purple.00:06:53	T	It is B and D you have to think about.00:06:56	T	In B and D, what else is in there besides starch?00:06:59	SN	Saliva.00:07:00	T	Saliva is in there. Because saliva did something to the starch, they became like this, right?00:07:06	T	Became like this, right?00:07:07	T	That's what I want you to think about.00:07:08	SN	Yes.00:07:10	T	And what are the conditional difference in the experiment between B and D?00:07:16	T	What was the conditional difference between B and D?00:07:17	SN	Hot water and uh-00:07:18	SN	Ice //water.00:07:19	S	//ice water.00:07:20	T	//ice water. This one is warm. This one is cold. From these differences summarize your results.00:07:31	S?	Yes.00:07:32	T	The bluish purple is no longer bluish purple. That means the starch is?00:07:36	SS	Gone.00:07:37	T	That means the starch is gone. How?00:07:42	SN	By hot water.00:07:43	T	By hot water?00:07:45	T	How about this group?00:07:49	T	This group also had a good result.00:07:53	SN	But teacher, this one became pale reddish brown.00:07:59	T	Well, pale reddish brown is sort of okay... they became a somewhat similar color, right?00:08:09	S	But this one is orange.00:08:17	T	Let me see... look, does the fact that they became bluish purple- they are bluish purple- mean they have starch or not?00:08:28	Ss	They have.00:08:29	T	They have, right?00:08:30	T	A and C only have starch. Since they have nothing but starch, it is natural that they become bluish purple.00:08:39	T	But in B and D, especially B, the bluish purple became pale. The fact that the bluish purple became pale means what happened to the starch?00:08:48	SN	It dissolved.00:08:49	T	It dissolved or, in other words, the starch is disappearing, right?00:08:54	T	In B and D, especially in B, what did we add?00:08:59	T	What did we add?00:09:01	T	What did we add to B?00:09:02	SN	Benedict's solution.00:09:03	T	What?00:09:04	SN	Saliva.00:09:05	T	We put spit in B. Spit, right? Slimy saliva.00:09:07	S	Saliva.00:09:08	T	That's what we added, right?00:09:10	T	Then saliva is doing something to the starch.00:09:16	T	It's all right to say dissolved or some kind of expression like that. From that, saliva (does what) to the starch?00:09:29	T	Right?00:09:31	T	Oh, one more thing. B and D are the same. They both contain saliva and starch. What is the conditional difference in the experiment?00:09:40	SN	Hot water and cold water.00:09:41	T	That's right. Hot water and cold water. From that//-00:09:42	SN	//Teacher, that part is (inaudible).00:09:45	T	Huh? Does this have a hole here?00:09:48	T	Work hard. If you include that, I think you will have a good summary of the study.00:09:56	T	Well, well.00:10:00	SN	What is it?00:10:03	T	This group's results... This group's results are super.00:10:09	T	If you cannot write a summary of the study from this good result, you are-00:10:14	T	[mimetic expression]00:10:16	SN	You mean (inaudible)?00:10:18	T	Did I say a thing like that?00:10:20	S	No, no.00:10:21	T	Well, so... should we look at it from here?00:10:25	T	Well, A and C became all bluish purple, right?00:10:31	T	Does that mean that there is starch or not?00:10:35	SS	There is.00:10:36	T	There is, right? From the beginning to the end, there is always starch in these.00:10:39	T	But in B and D, a difference appeared. In B and D, although both have starch, we added something special. What was that?00:10:48	SN	Saliva.00:10:49	T	Saliva. Only those test tubes which have saliva have such a result.Especially B has a distinct change. It did not turn to bluish purple. That means what happened to the starch?00:10:59	S	There is none.00:11:00	T	Yes. The starch disappeared. The starch disappeared.00:11:03	T	Saliva blah blah blah.00:11:09	SN	The one which we warmed up.00:11:10	T	Yes, that's it.00:11:12	SN	A, B.00:11:13	SS	This is the one which we cooled down.00:11:14	T	Well noticed. The conditional difference between B and D in this experiment is this one is warm, this one is cold.00:11:21	T	If you compare the speed in which the starch disappears, which is faster, B or D?00:11:26	SS	B.00:11:27	T	B is faster. That means... (inaudible). You must be able to figure it out.00:11:32	SN	Hm?00:11:33	T	Almost.00:11:34	S	One more push?00:11:36	T	If you can summarize this result, you are in perfect shape.00:11:39	T	Very good. Very good.00:11:42	T	Okay, this group.00:11:49	T	Looks good, looks good, looks good. Good. Good.00:12:07	T	When we looked at it... everyone look, all right?00:12:11	T	A and C got all bluish purple, right? Does that mean that there is starch or not?00:12:20	SN	There is.00:12:21	T	There is, right? Because they turned to bluish purple. A and C have starch only, so it is natural to have an iodine reaction.00:12:28	T	But B and D... especially in B, a change has occurred.00:12:34	T	B has starch plus, like it is written here, saliva.00:12:39	T	B's test tube which contains saliva changed from bluish purple to not changed to bluish purple... that's an odd way to say00:12:47	T	It no longer turned to bluish purple, that means starch disappeared due to the saliva, right?00:13:00	T	It will be good if you can write things like that in the summary of the study.00:13:03	T	In addition to that, this group noticed that in comparing B and D, D did not turn pale around here, did it?00:13:13	SN	It may have.00:13:14	T	It may have?00:13:16	S	Around here, only here became pale.00:13:18	T	It became pale? The conditional difference between B and D is the temperature, right? You noticed the difference in the temperature, right?00:13:28	T	That's a good point. That's good. In addition to that... which one had Benedict's solution... Oh, they became the same color?00:13:38	T	In that case, it will be difficult to write the summary of the study, huh?00:13:42	T	Well, well, well, well, well.00:13:46	T	Look. Look.00:13:59	T	These are (the results of) one group.00:14:08	T	Both of yours got this color?00:14:14	T	Well, if (your results) are like that, you cannot write the summary of the study. Since they turned to the same color, you cannot compare.00:14:21	T	This other group got these results. Why don't you think about it from these?00:14:24	T	Only B is reacting. We cannot say from this that A has reacted. From these (results), think about parenthesis two of the study. Only B has reacted.00:14:46	T	How about this group? Oh, nothing. What happened?00:14:50	SS	We don't understand. We don't understand.00:14:53	T	You don't understand. Well then should we do it together?00:14:56	T	You have nice results, you know? Here we go.00:15:00	T	A and C all turned to bluish purple, right?00:15:04	SN	Yes.00:15:05	T	Does that mean they have starch or not?00:15:09	SS	They have.00:15:10	T	They have, right? From the beginning to the end, they all have starch.00:15:12	T	However, B and D, especially B here, lost its bluish purple color.00:15:20	T	B has starch in it just as A and C, but it has something plus starch. What does it have?00:15:25	SS	Saliva.00:15:26	T	Yes, saliva. In the one which contains saliva, the bluish purple is no longer bluish purple. That means, the starch... due to the saliva-00:15:40	SN	Got eliminated.00:15:41	T	Yes, yes. Something like that.00:15:42	T	It got eliminated. Starch has disappeared. You can conclude like that.00:15:51	SN	Can we write the starch is gone?00:15:52	T	Right, right. Expressing it like that is fine.00:15:54	T	Hm, that's fine.00:16:00	SN	That's fine.00:16:01	T	That's fine.00:16:03	T	The guys have written nothing.00:16:06	SN	I'm not a man!00:16:08	T	Oh, I'm sorry.00:16:09	T	Next, how about the Benedict's solution? It didn't turn reddish brown... Oh, I see.00:16:15	T	You put Benedict's solution in A and B, you put Benedict's solution in A and B, and when you heat it, only B has reacted.00:16:22	T	That means, what's in B?00:16:23	SS	Sugar.00:16:24	T	Sugar is in it. That means... as I said before... the starch in B has disappeared because of the saliva, and what is made?00:16:31	SS	Sugar.00:16:33	SN	Ohh.00:16:34	T	Wonderful.00:16:35	SN	//Starch has disappeared.00:16:35	SN	//Thank you. [play on words]00:16:36	SS	[laughter]00:16:39	T	You are welcome.00:16:42	T	How about this group?00:16:44	SN	We have summarized most of it, even though we have not written yet.00:16:49	SN	This sentence is wrong though.00:16:51	T	Whose answer is right?00:16:52	SN	I don't know whether this is right or not, but we are summarizing by talking, and I did most of the summarizing.00:16:58	SN	We were summarizing by talking.00:17:00	T	So, shall we check?00:17:01	SN	Yes.00:17:02	T	Ah! These are wonderful results as well. If you cannot summarize these results, you are... Kenji-00:17:08	SN	Yes.00:17:09	T	Nothing.00:17:11	T	Well, when we look at this, A and C are all purple, that means that the starch has reacted. That means that there is starch in A and C till the end, right?00:17:21	T	But in B and D, (the circles) are colored red, which means that the starch has not reacted, iodine has not reacted, right?00:17:27	T	This means that in B and D, we put starch and saliva, but due to the function of saliva, starch has blah blah blahed, has blah blah blahed. What is it?00:17:40	SN	Dissolved.00:17:41	T	Yeah, dissolved. In normal language, it has disappeared. We can understand that starch has disappeared due to the function of saliva.00:17:51	T	Then, what is the difference in the experimental conditions of B and D?00:17:54	SN	Temperature.00:17:55	T	Temperature. B is?00:17:56	SN	Uh, 40 degrees.00:17:57	SN	Body temperature.00:17:58	SN	//Close to the body temperature.00:17:58	T	//Yes body temperature, and D is?00:17:59	SN	Ice water.00:17:59	T	It's cold.00:18:00	T	Which has a faster rate of change in which starch becomes no longer starch, B or D?00:18:06	SN	B.00:18:07	T	B is faster. That means that saliva's rate of effect on starch is... the temperature?00:18:13	S	Faster when it is closer to the body temperature.00:18:14	T	Ahh, wonderful. That's perfect.00:18:18	S	We said that before.00:18:19	T	In addition to that, which one becomes red brown?00:18:24	SS	B.00:18:25	T	B. That means that while saliva changed the starch, what other than starch was made?00:18:31	S	Sugar.00:18:32	T	Ah. Kenji.00:18:33	SN	Yes.00:18:34	T	You have good friends.00:18:35	S	Yes.00:18:36	SN	//Are we friends?00:18:37	T	//How about this group?00:18:38	SN	I didn't know that we were friends.00:18:44	T	Are you writing now?00:18:50	T	Let me check it. Let me see. Let me take a look at Takashi's.00:18:57	T	This one, too.00:18:58	SN	We did not do the first one.00:18:59	T	Oh, you didn't do the first one.00:19:00	T	This one, too.00:19:04	T	Ohh, it became reverse... Umm, what I want to check with you is that when they are bluish purple, when they are bluish purple. Does this mean they have starch or not?00:19:19	SS	They have.00:19:20	T	They have, right? When they are not bluish purple, the starch is?00:19:24	SN	Not there.00:19:25	T	Not there. Consider that. In the case of B, eventually, and in the case of D, from the beginning00:19:32	T	When we compare B and D, in both cases the starch disappears.00:19:35	T	Because of what? In B and D, there is starch plus what?00:19:39	SS	Saliva.00:19:40	T	There is saliva. You have to figure out what the saliva did. In addition to that, what was the conditional difference between B and D?00:19:49	SN	Temperature.00:19:50	T	Temperature. B is?00:19:51	SN	Forty degrees.00:19:52	T	Forty degrees. D?00:19:56	T	Cold.00:19:57	SN	Cold.00:19:58	T	That means that... saliva works differently depending on the temperature. What was that?00:20:07	T	You see that saliva works differently, right, depending on the temperature.00:20:10	T	And then, reddish brown... orange... oh, both changed...then it is hard to write the summary.00:20:19	T	So-00:20:31	T	Because you cannot proceed to the conclusion when you have the same reaction- this is from a different group by the way- only B has reacted. Only B became reddish brown.00:20:42	T	A did not react. I hope that you can come to a conclusion from this result. Right?00:20:53	T	What is it, Nishi-kun?00:20:54	SN	I don't understand it.00:20:56	T	Okay.00:20:57	T	This group is left.00:20:59	T	Yes.00:21:02	SN	What should we write in number two?00:21:04	SS	Is it because starch is made, that sugar is made? No, is it because the starch has disappeared, that sugar is made?00:21:10	T	In the beginning of the class- look at that- the result of breaking up the long chain of starch is sugar.00:21:22	SN	Is it sugar because the long chain has been broken up?00:21:25	T	Sugar is the result of what was originally big becoming small. Sugar. It is part of starch.//00:21:29	S	//Part of starch is sugar? Because starch disappeared, sugar is made?00:21:34	T	Well, you may say it in that way.00:21:36	SN	What is the best way to say it?00:21:39	T	Well, we will summarize that at the end.00:21:44	T	Then, this group last. How is it?00:21:46	SN	(inaudible)00:21:47	T	Sorry, sorry. Which one?00:21:56	T	Okay, Okay, you got the results. In this group, A and C are all bluish purple. That means, do these have starch or not?00:22:04	SN	They do.00:22:05	T	They all have starch, right? Because they have only starch in them.00:22:09	T	But B and D are no longer just bluish purple. So when we look at it, as time passes, does the bluish purple get lighter or darker?00:22:20	SS	Lighter.00:22:21	T	It gets lighter, right? What's in B and D besides the starch? What is it?00:22:25	SN	Sugar.00:22:26	T	Right. What? Sugar?00:22:27	S	Not sugar.00:22:28	SN	Saliva.00:22:29	T	Saliva. Hideki's saliva was real gooey.00:22:32	SS	Gooey?00:22:34	T	That means, do B and D have or not have starch at one point?00:22:39	SN	They do not.00:22:40	T	They do not. Starch is... because of what effect?00:22:45	S	Saliva's effect.00:22:46	T	That's right. Due to Hideki's saliva, starch has... disappeared. That's what you should write. Let me see.00:23:02	T	In addition to that, what is the conditional difference between B and D?00:23:05	SN	Ice.00:23:06	T	Right. //Ice and00:23:07	SN	//Ice and hot water.00:23:08	T	Yes, hot water. Which one is hot water?00:23:09	S	B.00:23:10	T	B. What about D?00:23:12	SN	Ice.00:23:13	T	Yes. Are these the same? Oh, these are exactly the same.... I see....00:23:19	T	Then it is hard to write about the different temperature. Okay, then you can write only this part.00:23:24	T	You can summarize the part that due to saliva, starch became no longer starch.00:23:28	T	Lastly, Benedict's solution. It's good.00:23:31	T	Only in B, only in B, has Benedict's solution reacted. This means that in B the starch has disappeared and what was made instead?00:23:42	SN	Sugar.00:23:44	T	It will be good if you can summarize that part. Okay?00:23:50	T	All right, since it has taken a long time, I would like to listen to each group's result now. So, be ready to listen to everyone.00:24:01	T	Now, everyone's- Ayamoto-san, okay? I will ask the results of each group. First, how the iodine reacted? For example, A was like this, B was like that.00:24:18	T	Or A and C were the same... It will be good if you can present the results in that way.00:24:21	T	Rock, paper, scissors... Rock, paper, scissors will do.00:24:28	T	And number two. Benedict's solution. We added Benedict's solution to A and B and heated them.00:24:35	T	Please describe what happened. Up to this point are the results.00:24:37	T	The conclusion is next. First, I will ask you about the results. I think I first want to ask you about the results.00:24:44	T	Where should I start? The results.00:24:55	T	Shall we start here? There? There? Over there?00:25:00	T	Group four, shall we? Okay. I see. Let's start with group four. It doesn't matter where we start. All right, please tell us your results.00:25:10	T	Please listen. Hey, Ayamoto, this is the second time.00:25:16	T	Please go ahead.00:25:17	SN	A, B... oops. A, C, and D were bluish purple the whole way through. //B became paler little by little.00:25:22	T	//Yes. All the wa-00:25:25	T	From which point did it start getting pale?00:25:26	S	From about the third one, it started //getting paler.00:25:30	T	//Yes. Yes. A, C and D are all bluish purple, but... Oh, please don't sit down yet. B started getting paler from about the third one. That was the report.00:25:44	T	And how about the Benedict's solution?00:25:48	S	The Benedict's solution in test tube A did not turn to reddish brown.00:25:54	T	Yes.00:25:55	S	B changed from blue to green, and when we kept heating it, it turned to reddish brown.00:26:01	T	That was a wonderful way to say that. It turned from blue to green, and when it kept being heating, it turned to reddish brown.00:26:08	T	So, in other words, B reacted. I see.00:26:11	T	Well then, group five. Please report your results.00:26:22	T	Go ahead.00:26:28	T	You only have to say it.00:26:31	SN	A... The first one was bluish purple... and the second one did not change-00:26:46	T	Did not change, does that mean that it was bluish purple?00:26:48	S	Yes.00:26:49	T	Then?00:26:51	S	And the fifth one was (inaudible).00:26:54	T	The fifth one? Did you just jump to the fifth? Huh?00:27:01	S	It became weaker and weaker.00:27:03	T	A got weaker and weaker? Huh? Is it reversed?00:27:11	T	Wait a minute. In which ones did you put saliva and starch?00:27:16	S	B and D.00:27:17	T	B and D. You put saliva in B and D, but A's color changed from purple to a weak purple, is that right? I see. And then?00:27:25	S	And B started losing its color after three minutes.00:27:31	T	This one, too, started losing its color?00:27:35	S	Yes.00:27:36	T	I see. Then?00:27:40	S	C... didn't change at all.00:27:47	T	All bluish purple. And?00:27:50	S	D... the color got weaker after 5 minutes. //The rest did not change.00:27:55	T	//After 5 minutes-00:27:57	T	The rest of the part were bluish purple. I see. Then what about the Benedict's solution?00:28:06	S	A became dark green, //and B was reddish brown.00:28:08	T	//Yes.00:28:12	T	Ah, so only B reacted. I see. Group five has reported that A seemed to become pale, too. I see. Then, group six, please.00:28:25	SN	A and C were bluish purple all the way, B changed from dark bluish purple to pale bluish purple-00:28:37	T	I see. Okay.00:28:39	S	D was bluish purple for about three minutes, and after that it slowly turned pale.00:28:48	T	I see. Then, what about the Benedict's solution?00:28:52	S	A and B both became reddish brown.00:28:56	T	I see, I see. Both of them became reddish brown. I see. Okay, group seven, please.00:29:06	SN	A and C and D were all bluish purple, and B started off bluish purple and became lighter.00:29:16	T	From what point did it start getting lighter?00:29:17	S	From the beginning.00:29:19	T	Oh, I see, it got lighter from the beginning. I see. Then what about the Benedict's solution?00:29:25	S	Test tube A was pale reddish brown.00:29:30	T	Yes. Pale-//00:29:31	S	//And B, dark reddish brown.00:29:34	T	I see. Well... which one is the closest? This one I believe. Please take a look at this.00:29:54	T	This one is the same test results of students like you- I wonder which class it was? Class four, class five, or class three?00:30:00	T	The results of students like you in those classes.00:30:05	T	Although we heard slightly different test results in this class, basically A and C are all bluish purple. The reason is that we put only starch in A and C, right?00:30:26	T	So there is only starch and although the temperature is different, the starch remains starch from beginning to end.00:30:35	T	So, many of you have reported that the bluish purple continued all the way, although some have reported that it got pale around here.00:30:45	T	The question is B and D. The question is B and D.00:30:49	T	There is saliva in the starch in B and D. We see a reaction in both B and D; that is, their color eventually gets lighter.00:31:01	T	Does that mean there is starch or not?00:31:05	SN	It's disappearing.00:31:06	T	It's disappearing, right? It doesn't, right? It is disappearing. The reason why is probably because we put saliva in them... that leads to our conclusion.00:31:16	T	In addition to that, when we look at B and D more carefully, the rate that saliva disappears, no, sorry, the rate that starch disappears, when we compare B and D, which is faster?00:31:26	SS	B.00:31:27	T	B is faster, right? B is faster. What was the conditional difference between B and D?00:31:33	SN	Temperature.00:31:34	T	Temperature. B is... warm. As warm as body temperature. D is cold.00:31:41	T	When we compare these, this one works the best, and I think that it will be good if you can include things like that in the conclusion.00:31:51	T	And then there was such group... not this one, this one.00:32:01	T	This one also has similar results, right? A and C have only starch, so they are bluish purple all the way through.00:32:09	T	They put saliva in B and D, but in B, after about two minutes there was already no reaction for starch.00:32:18	T	There was no starch at this point.00:32:20	T	In D, the reaction to starch got weaker and weaker, and there was no starch at this point, then it revived. I don't get this. I wish this one weren't here.00:32:32	T	But we see the color got weaker and weaker.00:32:37	T	Then there is this one. This one is amazing. We discovered a new type of human.00:32:42	SS	[laughter]00:32:44	T	Do you see? A and C are okay. In B, it suddenly disappeared here. More over in D, the starch suddenly disappeared here.00:32:57	T	I won't say whose it was. It was Hiroshi Wakai's.00:33:00	SS	[laughter]00:33:02	T	All right. Anyway, all you need to understand is in B and D, the starch has changed to something else.00:33:11	T	In addition to that, we added Benedict's solution. We put Benedict's solution in A and B.00:33:17	T	Look at this. I think it should react and become something like this.00:33:22	T	A has only starch in it.00:33:26	T	From this color, we cannot say it has reacted, when we put this against a florescent light and look at it through the light.00:33:34	T	This one did. It got thicker and became reddish brown. It is the color of carrot juice.00:33:41	T	When it reacts like this, we can judge that there is sugar in it. Actually, there seems to be sugar in B.00:33:50	T	I wish to include this content in our conclusion.00:33:56	T	First, the conclusions from the results of the iodine reaction. Second, the conclusions from the results of the Benedict's solution. These two. Can you present them?00:34:15	T	We had eye contact. Group eight? Please.00:34:24	SN	The iodine reaction: When saliva is mixed with starch, it becomes no longer starch.00:34:30	T	Yes.00:34:31	S	And the rate in which starch disappears is faster when we heat it.00:34:34	T	Mm, mm, mm.00:34:36	S	Concerning the reaction to Benedict's solution, when starch is mixed with saliva, sugar is formed.00:34:42	T	Mm.00:34:43	S	That's it.00:34:44	T	Mm, that's it? I see. That's good. That's good. That's good.00:34:52	T	Next, group one. Can you do it?00:35:01	T	Ryuutaro? or //Takashi?00:35:02	SN	//Is only the first point, okay?00:35:03	T	Huh?00:35:04	S	The first point.00:35:05	T	Only the first point. That's fine. Since the conclusion is difficult. Okay, go ahead.00:35:08	S	When we compare test tubes A and B, A does not change, but the starch in B, in which saliva is added-00:35:23	T	The starch in B was dissolved by the saliva little by little. Yes. Yes. That's fine. When we compare A and B, we can see that in B, in which saliva was added, the starch has dissolved little by little. Okay. That's fine.00:35:35	T	Okay, group two.00:35:38	SN	Uh-00:35:41	T	What do you mean by, "uh"?00:35:43	S	Human's saliva has a function of dissolving starch. And the closer its temperature is to body temperature, the faster the rate.00:35:56	S	B- oops- the second point is that the human saliva has the function of changing starch into sugar.00:36:08	T	Haa. I am amazed. Wonderful.00:36:12	SN	Actually, I am the one who summarized it.00:36:13	SS	[laughter]00:36:17	T	I see. That was a nice presentation. It was very logical, good conclusion. Then, how about the group three?00:36:24	SN	Yes.00:36:25	T	Yes.00:36:27	S	In terms of the reaction with iodine, the one with saliva became less and less starchy.00:36:34	T	Yes.00:36:35	S	Then, in terms of the reaction with Benedict's solution, by adding saliva, starch became sugar.00:36:46	T	Yes. I think it's very good. This was also a nice presentation, don't you think? I think it's good.00:36:51	T	Well then, I will summarize each group's presentation into sentences, so please write them down in your notebook. I think we can summarize like this.00:37:03	B	Summary- saliva has the function of dissolving starch into sugar.00:37:53	B	Saliva's function of dissolving the starch into sugar works best when the temperature is close to body temperature.00:39:12	T	Oh, maybe it is hard to see. Should I lower this?00:39:20	SN	Teacher, I think the OHP is not very useful.00:39:22	T	What are you talking about? I pointed to them like this.00:39:25	S	Isn't it faster to use that one? Rather than using the heavy OHP?00:39:26	T	No, you don't understand it. Because of this everyone understood well. Well, don't say that.00:39:39	T	Ok, did everyone finish writing?00:39:42	T	Um, from this experiment, we can see these two things, as you all noticed.00:39:49	T	The first one is that saliva seems to have the function of changing starch into something else.00:39:57	T	Saliva may have a function which changes starch into something else.00:40:03	T	Moreover, from the iodine reaction and Benedict's solution's reaction, starch into something else- so, what is it? Sugar. We wonder if there is a function of changing starch into sugar.00:40:17	T	As I said in the beginning of the class, starch is a long chain. A long molecule. At a glance, it is a huge molecule.00:40:26	T	But sugar is a small molecule. A short chain. From this, we understand that saliva has the function of breaking a big chain of starch into a small chain of sugar.00:40:44	T	Next, the second point. Um, from the conditional differences between B and D, the difference in the temperature,00:40:53	T	I think we understand that saliva works best when the temperature is close to body temperature.00:41:04	T	All right, please open your textbooks to page 94. There will be a part you should underline. So be prepared and listen.00:41:16	T	All right, we will start. Page 94.00:41:23	T	After "from experiment two," please underline.00:41:27	T	"Starch is dissolved by saliva and changes into sugar." Please underline up to this point. "Starch is dissolved by saliva and changes into sugar."00:41:42	T	Next you don't have to underline. "Also, because this sugar's molecule is smaller than starch, it can go through cellophane membrane." Okay, underline after this.00:41:52	T	"Other than saliva, such fluids as gastric juice and pancreatic juice, which have the function of digesting food, are called digestive fluid." Underline up to here.00:42:03	T	Next. This will be a long one too.00:42:06	T	"In digestive fluid..." Underline here, "In digestive fluid, there are different kinds of digestive enzymes.00:42:12	T	"Under appropriate temperature it dissolves components in food and changes them into nourishment which is easily absorbed."00:42:22	T	Mm. Our textbooks are all marked with red now.00:42:26	T	The next (section) too. This is all important. This page will be all marked with red. Sorry. Underline the next (section).00:42:30	T	"Each digestive enzyme dissolves particular food components such as: digestive enzymes in saliva (amylase) work on starch,00:42:35	T	"digestive enzymes in gastric juice work on protein, and so on." Underline up to here.00:42:47	T	It was a long explanation, but I will summarize for you to write in your notebooks. Since it is hard to understand otherwise.00:43:00	B	[Digestive fluid... Fluid which has the function of digesting food. Example: saliva, gastric juice, etc.]00:44:04	B	[Digestive enzymes have specific food components to dissolve. Example: Saliva (amylase) works only on starch - glucose]00:46:08	B	[Gastric juice //(pepsin) works only on protein - amino acid]00:46:12	T	//Can you see it?00:46:51	T	I wonder whether people can see at the bottom. Chiho, can you see this?00:46:55	T	Can you see this?00:46:56	SN	(inaudible)00:46:57	T	Can you see? Sorry.00:47:01	T	Can you see this part, gastric juice?00:47:02	S	Yes.00:47:03	T	You can. Sorry. This is very low.00:47:22	T	Are you all right? Oh, I should underline here.00:47:41	T	Today's topic, saliva. Which has the function of dissolving starch into sugar. Saliva.00:47:48	T	Saliva is called digestive fluid. Digestive fluid. Fluid to dissolve starch into sugar. Saliva is digestive fluid.00:47:57	T	Fluid which digests food is called digestive fluid. Digestive fluid is not only saliva. There is gastric juice which is in the stomach.00:48:07	T	When you throw up, you have a sour taste in your mouth. That's gastric juice. Go deeper down and we have pancreatic juice in the pancreas, or bile in the gallbladder, and so on.00:48:20	T	We call these fluids, which digest food, "digestive fluids." In addition, in the digestive fluids, there are digestive enzymes.00:48:31	T	We read this as "enzymes." You didn't write "oxygen" in your notebook, did you?00:48:38	T	Are you okay? It's not oxygen. It's enzymes. Okay? Chinese characters?00:48:45	T	In digestive fluid, there are digestive enzymes. These digestive enzymes are determined by the food components they dissolve.00:48:56	T	For example, saliva works only on starch, which we experimented with this time. You must have learned in home science.00:49:01	T	Five major nutrient categories. Protein, fat. There are many nutrient categories, but saliva only works on starch.00:49:12	T	And gastric juice in the stomach, which I mentioned before, works only on protein.00:49:19	T	Such digestive enzymes which have specific functions are included in digestive fluids.00:49:27	T	This is a little bit difficult, so we will look at this in detail in the next lesson.00:49:35	T	All right, we will finish today's lesson, but please turn in your report. All right, that's it.00:49:43	SN	Stand up.00:50:00	S	Bow.00:50:01	T	Yes.00:50:05	T	Please turn in your reports.Ê               Bottom of Form
