00:00:03	T	I'm wherever you are, fella. You should all have a book. If you haven't got one, please come and get one.00:00:11	SN	Mr. Brown ah, that test.00:00:14	T	Yeah.00:00:15	S	Ah, the pH one. Would I be able to do that one again?00:00:17	T	Yes. Of course you can.00:00:18	S	Cool.00:00:20	T	Tony, we need to get that test of yours done again too some time. All right? When are you ready for it?00:00:28	SN	Um.00:00:30	T	Did you take the ah- did you take something home last night to study? You didn't.00:00:36	T	No, you've got to get yourself organised. Adam, that's not on.00:00:43	T	All right.00:00:44	SN	Mr. Brown. Can I please go get my book?00:00:45	T	Yeah, hurry up ah, Walter.00:00:51	T	Okay. Now let's just look at where we're at. Yesterday you know very well what we did. Okay, Liam, how about you telling me what we did- what we finished off doing yesterday.00:01:02	SN	Um yesterday we were examining the hairs, but today we prepared- oh-00:01:09	T	Keep going.00:01:10	S	And we were doing, last lesson we were studying the layers of paint.00:01:15	T	Okay.00:01:16	S	Different colors and pigments.00:01:18	T	And so what did you learn- what did you learn from that? Karen.00:01:22	SN	I don't know- colors?00:01:25	T	Sorry?00:01:26	S	Lots of different colors.00:01:28	T	Oh, okay, fine. Lots of different colours. All right. Do you agree Daniel?00:01:33	SN	Yes, I agree.00:01:35	T	Okay. Stop being so formal by the way.00:01:38	T	Okay, so yesterday you had the microscope. You looked at the paint chips.00:01:45	T	The previous day you looked at the hairs under the microscope and you looked at the different fibers.00:01:49	T	Okay, but yesterday's class went very well because you in fact- all of you were able to get very, very good microscope shots of the different layers of paint.00:02:00	T	Today, as I- I talked to you yesterday, we are going to do an activity on fingerprinting. All right.00:02:05	T	Um, fingerprinting, it's actually contained in the- in this- in this book here that both Mr. Hathaway and Ms. Moller are co-authors of.00:02:14	T	Um, the pages, we start on page er, page 14 and er, page- I'd better get the page right, haven't I.00:02:21	T	Page 14 on fingerprints. What we're going to do, we're going to do a couple of activities.00:02:27	T	We're going to do- you're going to make fingerprints, you're actually going to take your own fingerprints.00:02:32	T	You are going to examine those fingerprints under a hand lens.00:02:37	T	You'll actually then put them in your book, so you've got a permanent record in your own science book of your own fingerprints.00:02:44	T	Ah, there's soap and towels up the back there so you can wash your hands after doing that. There are some questions. I don't know if you'll have time to answer those questions today.00:02:54	T	Um, the next activity- we've got a fair bit to do. The second one will be dusting for fingerprints.00:03:00	T	Okay? Now, in that we've got a whole series of different surfaces. They're up behind Liam and Allison there.00:03:08	T	There are different surfaces. If you just turn around this way for a moment please. The paper here is to stop getting ah, all the powder on the desk.00:03:20	T	There are different surfaces. You've got these porcelain, a nice hard porcelain surface that you can put a print on.00:03:30	T	Um, you've got paper, you can do a print with paper. You can do a print- put a print on this.00:03:37	T	Now, the point is that once- once you touch something, what- what happens when you ah, when you touch something?00:03:42	SN	Puts a fingerprint on it.00:03:43	T	//Sorry, Ally?00:03:43	SN	//Puts a fingerprint on it.00:03:45	T	Okay. Why does it leave a fingerprint on it, Ally?00:03:48	SN	Sweat? Oil? Everything?00:03:53	T	Grease. Sorry, Adam.00:03:56	SN	No, nothing. I was just.00:03:57	T	Okay. That's all right. You can say it.00:03:59	S	No.00:04:01	T	All right, so, you leave grease and that- oi- oils behind. And therefore, what we're going to do is try to get something to stick to those oils to make it visible.00:04:12	T	Well, we've got two types of ah powder.00:04:14	T	We've got talcum powder there, like a salt shaker really. And we've also got carbon powder there. We've also got some brushes.00:04:25	T	Why would we use the ah- why would I have- why would I have two different sorts of powder? Samuel?00:04:31	SN	The difference is-00:04:32	T	Sorry?00:04:32	S	To see what the difference is.00:04:35	T	Yeah. Just give me some more-00:04:37	SN	For different surfaces.00:04:38	T	Okay. So for this for example, what am I going to use on this if I wanted to see the print?00:04:42	SN	Black.00:04:43	T	Yeah, exactly. So to do with the- the contrast.00:04:47	T	And then when you've done that, hopefully that'll- you've got a brush there so you can- you can brush it very gently.00:04:52	T	When you um- when you've done that, what you can then finally do, once you've got the print, once you've got a reasonable copy of the print-00:05:00	T	You can take the sticky tape, put it over the print, over the surface, put the sticky tape over it, then when you lift off the sticky tape what should happen?00:05:08	SN	The print should come with it.00:05:10	T	The print should come with it and you can ah, stick that into your book. Okay.00:05:13	T	Now, um, I want to do one other thing, I want to show you another technique that I don't want you to do, but in fact this one here is, if I've got a rough surface.00:05:27	T	And for example- um, a piece of rough paper, what I'm going to do here is I'm going to put a print on it like that, okay.00:05:38	T	Now, that's a rough surface. It's not easy to get a print on it. I'm going to show you another technique. I'm going to put this in here.00:05:51	T	I'm now going to go over to the fume wood because I'm going- I'm using a compound, a chemical iodine.00:06:01	T	And... its vapours are a little bit ah unpleasant, so that's why I'm putting it in here.00:06:09	T	I'm just putting a couple of things of iodine in there. Iodine is a solid, but just like dry ice, what did dry ice do when it ah?00:06:19	SN	It melted.00:06:20	T	Did it melt?00:06:23	SN	Oh, it went //away.00:06:24	SN	It let off gases.00:06:25	T	It went straight from a solid to?00:06:26	Ss	Gas.00:06:27	T	Yeah. Iodine is exactly the same. It goes straight from a solid to a gas.00:06:32	T	And so, what I'm going to do- and as it turns into a gas, um, the iodine molecules will actually stick to the ah- the paper, and should make them ah visible.00:06:44	T	Anyway, we'll see by the end of the period. Okay.00:06:47	T	What I want you to do for just a- a couple of minutes is look over what we have to do- I know we looked over it a little bit yesterday.00:06:54	T	Look over what we have to do on, ah, pages 14 through to 17.00:07:01	T	Ah, sorry, 16. And ah, just for a moment, have a look over that then in a couple of minutes we'll actually get started on the activities. Okay.00:07:13	T	Don't read in detail, just- just overview it.00:07:19	T	You okay?00:07:19	SN	Yeah.00:07:20	SN	Do you have to write anything up?00:07:22	T	Um, yeah, you'll need to put a heading in your book, Ron, yes. Ah, fingerprinting. Just under where we did the paint chips. Right. And Ron. Spit it in the bin please.00:07:42	T	Okay.00:07:59	T	What's wrong?00:08:02	SN	I'm just laughing at Adam.00:08:03	T	Oh right.00:08:03	SN	Can you read it for me?00:08:07	T	You read very well, Adam. Heh?00:08:11	SN	Sir, (inaudible).00:08:18	T	Sorry?00:08:19	S	Do you want us to write what you've got on the board?00:08:21	T	Ah, no, I don't want you to write what I've got on the board there. That's just for you to refer to.00:08:28	SN	It's pretty bad!00:08:29	T	Yep?00:08:30	S	Do we just draw up a table like that?00:08:32	T	Sorry?00:08:33	S	Do we draw up a table like that?00:08:35	T	No, I've already got the sheets for you here.00:08:41	SN	Chuck, can I please borrow a pen?00:08:44	T	Haven't you even got a pen, Adam?00:08:46	S	I've lost my pencil case. Gary stole it.00:08:54	T	I don't think that's necessary, Gary.00:08:56	SN	I'm sorry.00:08:57	T	I can't believe you came to class without a pen, Adam.00:09:02	SN	Well, I've ah.00:09:04	T	It's not really a good way to go about your study is it?00:09:06	S	No.00:09:07	T	Heh. What's the problem?00:09:09	S	No, I just lost it. Like I-00:09:11	T	When?00:09:12	S	Two days ago. I had it (inaudible)-00:09:15	T	So you've been at school now for two days without a pen.00:09:17	S	Yeah.00:09:18	T	Great. Absolutely great, Adam. Okay.00:09:22	T	Tony, have you got a pen with you today? Tony.00:09:25	SN	(inaudible) sharpen it.00:09:26	SN	Yeah, I do.00:09:27	T	Good. I'm so delighted. Okay.00:09:32	T	All right. Jerry.00:09:34	SN	Yep.00:09:34	T	Just quickly tell us what we're going to do.00:09:36	S	Um put ah, get the ink and put our finger on it00:09:40	T	Yep.00:09:42	S	And then put our finger in the box that we draw up. The right one.00:09:47	T	Okay.00:09:48	S	And then examine them.00:09:50	T	Okay, examine them. Put them in your book? //Okay. They're the A4 sheets er- so you don't get your book all grubby. You can do it on these. They- that's what this is for over here.00:09:52	S	//Yeah.00:09:59	T	Ah, you'll have to be fairly efficient. That's the first bit. And then um, yep, Veronica, what are you going to do the second part of the experiment?00:10:07	SN	Um, answer the questions.00:10:12	T	Yeah, and then the activity though.00:10:14	S	Dust it off.00:10:15	T	Sorry.00:10:16	S	Dust it off.00:10:18	T	Okay, dust the? //Okay, Walter?00:10:19	SN	//Prints.00:10:22	SN	Um, do we draw up a table on... the sheet?00:10:25	T	Yeah, you draw up a table on here is- is the way to do it. Okay. All right. Now listen. I've talked enough and you've- you've sat down long enough. Let's get on with this.00:10:33	T	You all know what to do. Get- get on with it. Do the prints first and then we'll go on to the dusting of the surfaces. Up to you now.00:10:41	SN	How many can we work in?00:10:42	T	Ah, groups of two or three is fine.00:10:43	S	Yep.00:10:44	T	Okay.00:10:45	S	Chuck.00:10:49	SN	Stop acting, Mr. Brown.00:10:51	T	Oh, I hope I'm not acting.00:10:52	SN	You're acting Mr. (inaudible).00:10:53	SN	I think you are.00:10:54	T	Oh really.00:10:55	S	I think you are. You don't usually have everything all nice and prepared for class.00:11:00	T	Your comments are- have been recorded.00:11:03	SN	Mr. Brown (inaudible) A4 sheet.00:11:06	T	That's a bit unfair Christine, I think you're doing me a harsh injustice.00:11:11	S	You know how you gave us the A4 sheet?00:11:12	T	Yeah.00:11:13	S	Um, can we even just do it in our book anyway, or?00:11:15	T	Yes you can. Of course, yeah. It's just that sometimes it er-00:11:19	S	Smudges.00:11:19	T	It smudges. That's all.00:11:20	S	Yeah.00:11:24	T	How we going?00:11:26	SN	I can't eat Minties.00:11:27	T	Oh you've got your ah railway tracks in, right.00:11:30	S	Yeah.00:11:31	T	Does it hurt or not?00:11:32	SN	Metal mouth.00:11:32	SN	Yes, it kills.00:11:33	SN	Yeah, I sent you an email.00:11:34	SN	I sent you an email.00:11:35	T	How tight is it?00:11:36	SN	Pardon.00:11:37	T	How tight is it?00:11:38	S	I don't know how tight because it's the first time, so I don't know how tight they're meant to be.

Okay.00:11:53	S	Come on.00:11:55	T	You okay, Maria?00:11:56	SN	Yep.00:11:57	T	Good.00:11:58	SN	I'm not, I'm tired.00:12:00	T	Why?00:12:01	S	Cause- cause this school starts too early and finishes too late.00:12:04	T	Did you go to the play last night did you?00:12:05	S	No, I'm going tonight.00:12:06	SN	No, we're going tonight.00:12:07	SN	Because I'm going to Perth tomorrow.00:12:08	T	Ah, good.00:12:09	T	Sorry?00:12:10	S	I'm going to Perth tomorrow so I get to sleep in.00:12:11	T	Perth.00:12:13	SN	Is there any more ink? Ink?00:12:15	T	Ah, oh there should be a whole heap of ink pads. There should be enough between- one ink pad between four people. Yeah, they're just there.00:12:20	T	It won't take a moment.00:12:26	T	Oh, and soap and towels over here if you need to wash your hands.00:12:51	T	You may want to- you may care to put on a coat by the way if you don't want to get any ah- don't want to get grubby.00:12:58	SN	Excuse me, Mr. Brown, (Donald is being a ding-dong).00:13:02	T	Sorry?

Yeah.00:13:15	SN	Let me see your finger.00:13:16	T	The fingerprints work a little bit better if they're not quite so- so heavy. Don't put too much ink on your hands.00:13:24	SN	Get a new microphone thing.00:13:27	SN	Like that?00:13:28	T	Um well, yeah. That's probably a touch heavy. Just a little bit lighter. Maybe, if you'd use that again, the second time around it'll probably work okay.00:13:39	SN	Mr. Brown, is this good?00:13:42	T	It's terrific, Ron. //That's actually good.00:13:43	SN	//What about mine?00:13:46	S	Because I, I did (inaudible).00:13:47	T	Fine, perfect. A little, you know-00:13:49	S	//Give me five, Larry.00:13:50	T	Maybe a touch heavy, but that's good. All right.00:13:54	T	No. That's fantastic. Good. Not too heavy, that's all.00:14:01	SN	Are you meant to just do one hand?00:14:03	T	No, you're meant to do both hands. Okay.00:14:07	S	I just figured mine was a bit too heavy.00:14:09	T	Yeah, um, yeah. Sometimes, if you put one on there to- to take a little bit off the second one. That's much better, yes. Yeah.00:14:19	T	Because if you were leaving fingerprints, you wouldn't normally leave ah, ones like that would you?00:14:25	SN	We do like ones like this.00:14:26	T	Yeah, okay.00:14:27	SN	Are you going to get annoyed at us if we muck around in front of the camera?00:14:31	T	No. It's a normal class.00:14:34	SN	So (inaudible).00:14:38	T	Christine's already told me off, don't worry.00:14:40	SN	Is that better?00:14:41	T	That's perfect.

That shows it much more clearly.00:14:46	SN	Mr. Brown.00:14:48	T	That's fantastic.00:14:50	S	(inaudible) right hand and then all the things (inaudible).00:14:57	SN	Do we do both (hands)?00:14:58	T	It'll be the other way around won't it. The thumb, and then it'll be index. Middle.00:15:13	T	Remember when you do the right hand it goes in reverse order to the left hand, doesn't it.00:15:17	SN	Nah, it doesn't.00:15:18	T	Oh well.00:15:23	T	Okay, not too heavy, Tony. Christine, how we going?00:15:27	SN	Good.00:15:28	SN	Look at us (inaudible).00:15:31	T	That's good, yeah. Ron, you're actually now becoming annoying.

You dirty (inaudible).00:16:32	T	I might be looking for volunteers, Adam, at lunch time.00:16:35	SN	Why did Christine tell you off?00:16:38	T	Oh you know what Christine's like.00:16:40	S	Yeah I know she (inaudible).00:16:41	T	She thinks it's her job to- to get me- make me a better teacher.00:16:44	SN	That one was two blotches, so I did it again.00:16:45	T	Oh great, yeah that's good. Okay.00:16:48	S	Are they dark enough?00:16:49	T	I think they are actually, yeah. I think they're fine. They actually show the detail.00:16:53	T	Yeah. That's beautiful that one there, isn't it?00:16:56	T	That's- that- that one there is perfect because you can actually see the whirls, swirls.00:17:01	SN	Is this right?00:17:03	T	Yes, terrific, Vicky. Yeah, beautiful. And see that one- that one's perfect. See that?00:17:09	S	Yep.00:17:09	T	See all the fine detail there. Great. You need to label it though, don't you?00:17:12	S	Yep.00:17:13	T	Are you okay with that? Good.00:17:15	SN	I'm doing mine again because I didn't (inaudible)00:17:18	T	Okay. Right. It's actually better if it's not too heavy, isn't it.00:17:25	S	Yeah. See you can see the whirls.00:17:29	T	Oh yes, that's beautiful. That's really is perfect, isn't it. It's amazing to think that ah, it's fairly simple and yet no- they can identify people just from fingerprints.00:17:41	SN	Stop being so stupid.00:17:42	T	Right.00:17:44	SN	Ron, you're so immature.00:17:47	T	Are you right, Tony?00:17:48	SN	Can I start this, Mr. Brown?00:17:50	SN	Thanks, Ron00:17:51	T	Yes, yes. Just keep working your way through, Arnold.00:17:57	SN	Mr. Brown. Can you (inaudible) the second bit? I didn't understand it. Do you dust your own prints?00:18:01	T	Yes. You make a print.00:18:04	S	No, no, no. Do you- the ones that you've already made.00:18:06	T	Oh no, no, no, no, no, no, no, they-00:18:07	S	You make a second set.00:18:08	T	You make, yeah. //In other words-00:18:09	S	//Sorry, I-00:18:10	T	This is like you're a criminal and you've left a fingerprint.

The talcum-00:18:18	S	So I put dust on my fingers and //then-00:18:19	SN	//Mr. Brown.00:18:20	T	No, no, no, no. No. No.00:18:21	SN	Put my fingers down and then put the dust.00:18:22	SN	//Do you have to do?00:18:23	T	//You just touch the surface.00:18:24	SN	Yeah.00:18:25	T	Right. And then, surely you won't see anything.00:18:27	S	Yeah.00:18:28	T	So to try to make it visible you then use the- the dust. To see if it can-00:18:32	S	Then you put sticky tape on (inaudible).00:18:33	T	Yeah. Just like you're a- if you're a, if a police and you go into a room and ah- you want to find out what's happened.00:18:40	S	(inaudible).00:18:41	T	No, okay, you're not. Right.00:18:42	SN	Do you do everybody's hands? Everybody's hands.00:18:46	T	No, we don't have to be. It would be nice if yours were in your own book, Gary. Right.00:18:56	T	Can I just have your attention for one moment please?00:18:58	T	Is it cl- is it clear to you all that in the second activity you don't use the ink?00:19:04	T	And I'd rather you didn't spray that talcum powder into the air, thank you.

Okay.00:27:15	S	Is there like a special technique?00:27:17	T	No, there's not. No. I think you're brushing a bit too heavily, that's all.00:27:19	SN	(inaudible).00:27:22	SN	Mr. Brown.00:27:25	T	No, I can't ah.00:27:27	S	No?00:27:28	T	No. What I suggest you do, it might be better if you actually do it on the upper surface because that means that any ah- er- other powder will actually go off. You with me?00:27:39	SN	Yeah.00:27:40	T	Try it again. Just brush it down with some tape and then whichever- whichever sort of part of you might be the- have the most grease on it.00:27:48	T	Okay.
