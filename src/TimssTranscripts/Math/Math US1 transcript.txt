00:00:00	T	(inaudible) four. One for each group of four. Okay? Or three. Okay?
00:00:06	T	Okay guys, let's get started here. Okay, listen closely.
00:00:11	T	To save a little time I won't bring out my overhead like you're usually accustomed to.
00:00:14	SN	Dear...
00:00:15	SN	Thank you.
00:00:16	T	Okay? Instead, let me just tell you.
00:00:19	T	What I'm going to give you for each group is a little three-page packet. Okay?
00:00:26	T	What I need for you to do right now is, every one of you get out a blank sheet of paper. Every one of you needs a blank sheet of paper.
00:00:35	SN	Thank you.
00:00:38	S	Ashley, can I have a piece of paper?
00:00:41	T	Just put it right on the table back there, (inaudible).
00:00:43	S	Thank you.
00:00:58	T	Thank you Sarah. Don't leave without it, all right.
00:01:01	SN	Oh, (inaudible).
00:01:02	T	Okay. Now- Here you go.
00:01:11	T	All right.
00:01:13	T	Okay, so... listen closely now. Everybody ready?
00:01:18	S	Yep.
00:01:20	T	Okay, everybody within your group of four or three, you need to work together. I know normally we work in pairs.
00:01:27	T	Okay? But I figured today you have another pair of students-
00:01:33	T	You know, a couple of extra brains there to help you get through this little lesson. Okay? We've done this plenty of times before.
00:01:41	T	Some of you honestly are still a little shaky. So, if you look at the packet which you are all sharing as a group-
00:01:49	T	Page one has five equations I want you to graph. Now you can graph it any way that you know how to do it, as long as you do it correctly.
00:02:00	T	Can someone raise their hand and tell me what's one obvious thing that I can do to graph? Nick?
00:02:04	SN	The slope.
00:02:05	T	Use the slope with the?
00:02:07	SN	Y intercept and X intercept.
00:02:08	T	Y intercept. Right? That's probably the way you'll probably want to do it, right Nick?
00:02:11	S	Yeah.
00:02:12	T	Is there another way, though? Robert?
00:02:15	SN	Use the, um, tables.
00:02:16	T	Right, to make a table for the equation, right? And then plot the points from the table. Everyone got that?
00:02:21	T	So those are the two main ways, right, we can graph those equations? So right now I need you to get started.
00:02:27	T	The key thing is when you're done with the first five, the first page, as noted on the paper, please make sure I check to make-
00:02:35	T	Make sure you did it right before you move on. Okay? So go ahead and get started.
00:02:42	T	Nick, question?
00:02:43	SN	Where's the... oh, right here?
00:02:44	T	Yeah. You're going to graph on that. That is your result for your group.
00:02:48	S	So everybody has to do one graph, right?
00:02:49	T	Right.
00:02:50	T	So someone here can assign themselves as the grapher or whatever.
00:02:54	T	The rest of you kind of work together to make sure it's accurate. Okay? You going to do it? Good job, Nick.
00:03:01	T	Yes?
00:03:03	T	All right, the grid paper- All right, you know what? Hey, listen up real quick.
00:03:07	T	Five, four, three, two, one, zero. I probably forgot 'cause I'm still a little nervous. Okay?
00:03:14	T	But the grid paper, you have one per group. Right?
00:03:19	T	So I'm relying on one of you in that group to be the designated grapher for the group.
00:03:25	T	But the rest of you please help out- you know, help each other. Get the graphs done correctly. Okay?
00:03:35	T	There you go, Robert. So while he's doing that, let's get started on this, guys. What are we going to do?
00:03:39	SN	Do we write this on our piece of paper?
00:03:40	T	Yeah.
00:03:41	S	Oh, okay.
00:03:42	T	All right? This is actually the- use the ruler, Robert. Use the ruler man. Make it neat. All right?
00:03:48	SN	Mr. Ormsby, you know, when you put, like, a one in here, would you go like, times-
00:03:53	T	Ah, see, so now you've already forgotten, right? First of all zeros are our favorite number, right?
00:03:58	S	Yeah.
00:03:59	T	You put in zero. Two-thirds times zero is what?
00:04:02	S	Zero.
00:04:03	T	Plus eight is?
00:04:04	S	Eight.
00:04:05	T	Eight. Now because this fraction is a two-thirds, do you remember what I told you what numbers you should pick now?
00:04:11	S	Um, threes.
00:04:13	T	All right. So maybe zero, three and six would be good numbers to try with this one, right?
00:04:18	T	That way you don't have to worry about fractions and mixed numbers.
00:04:19	S	Okay.
00:04:20	T	Okay? All right.
00:04:22	SN	Mr. Ormsby, whoo-hoo. Okay. Mister, I forgot how to do these again. Like how do you do X and Y?
00:04:29	T	Okay, so now wait a minute. You want to make a table then, right? So you're going to make an X Y table, okay?
00:04:36	T	Now... the idea again is, to make our points we just pick any number we want for X.
00:04:42	T	We can do that, right? Everybody agree? Jenna?
00:04:45	SN	Yeah.
00:04:46	SN	So it was zero, one, two and-
00:04:47	T	Ah, that's true, except because this is a two-thirds fraction-
00:04:52	S	You want to pick three as like-
00:04:53	T	Exactly.
00:04:54	S	Negative three, zero and three.
00:04:56	T	Right, and if you want to just do zero, three, six and stay away from negatives, you can do that too. All right?
00:05:01	SN	I got six (inaudible) in the middle.
00:05:03	SN	So, zero, three, six.
00:05:04	SN	I get six.
00:05:06	T	Right.
00:05:07	S	Okay.
00:05:08	T	And you think you can do it on your own now? You just want to be on the camera. Okay.
00:05:13	S	No, that's not true.
00:05:14	T	Okay, we're going to put in zero here, right?
00:05:17	S	Okay.
00:05:18	T	What's two-thirds times zero?
00:05:19	S	Zero.
00:05:20	T	Everybody watching, right? Plus eight is?
00:05:22	S	Eight.
00:05:23	T	Eight.
00:05:24	S	So three times two is six.
00:05:26	T	Six.
00:05:27	S	Divided by three is two.
00:05:28	T	Three is two.
00:05:30	S	Plus eight is-
00:05:31	T	Eight is?
00:05:32	S	Ten. Okay I get it. Thank you Mr. Ormsby.
00:05:33	T	Okay. Good job.
00:05:34	S	So six times-
00:05:36	SN	All right, so, okay, this is what I did. I put three negative three, zero, three and six, all right?
00:05:37	T	Okay.
00:05:41	T	How come you have your table backwards? I've never done that before.
00:05:43	S	Well, I did that.
00:05:44	T	Okay.
00:05:45	SN	It's easier this way.
00:05:46	SN	It's easier.
00:05:47	T	All right, if you say so.
00:05:48	S	Anyways, I put negative three, so, I put two-thirds and then-
00:05:53	T	Times negative three.
00:05:54	S	Yeah. Negative three goes in the top, right?
00:05:56	T	Right. Well, you- negative three, you remember, is negative three over one. There you go.
00:06:00	S	So- so it's a one and a one. But that's a negative still, right?
00:06:03	T	Right. That's still a negative there.
00:06:04	S	So it's negative two?
00:06:05	SN	So it's negative two.
00:06:06	T	Plus eight is?
00:06:08	SN	Six.
00:06:09	T	Yeah.
00:06:10	S	See, I knew that.
00:06:11	T	So negative three is six, zero is eight. Now three I question, though. Try a positive three.
00:06:17	SN	Cause they're both positive so-
00:06:19	SN	Two-third so, three, one-
00:06:20	SN	Oh.
00:06:21	T	Okay.
00:06:22	SN	One one, and then three, eight, 11.
00:06:26	T	No, wait a minute. Wait a minute.
00:06:27	S	Two. One is-
00:06:28	SN	And five.
00:06:29	T	Two plus- wait a minute, no, you were "times-ing" it.
00:06:30	SN	Oh.
00:06:31	SN	It's two so-
00:06:32	SN	It's 10.
00:06:33	SN	Yeah.
00:06:34	T	It's 10. And then six is 12.
00:06:35	SN	It's six then 10 and 12.
00:06:36	SN	Okay.
00:06:38	T	All right. Yes?
00:06:39	SN	All right, I just totally forgot um, you know, how to do the graph.
00:06:43	T	Okay, now what I liked- you at least remember to use multiples. Like this one- Let's try this one right here. All right?
00:06:49	S	Okay.
00:06:50	T	You remembered to use fives, but let's try zero. If I put in zero there, what's three-fifths times zero?
00:06:55	S	Um... zero?
00:06:57	T	Right. Minus 10.
00:06:59	S	Is negative 10?
00:07:00	T	So put a negative 10 there. So now you're going to- now try five in there, right?
00:07:05	S	Okay.
00:07:06	T	So just write a little five there so you can mentally see it. So if I do three times five that's?
00:07:11	S	Fifteen.
00:07:12	T	Now remember I'm going to divide by the five, which gives me?
00:07:14	S	Three.
00:07:15	T	Minus 10.
00:07:18	S	Negative seven.
00:07:19	T	Good job. I think you got it now.
00:07:21	S	Oh, okay.
00:07:22	T	All right. Finish it up.
00:07:22	SN	Mr. Ormsby?
00:07:23	T	All right.
00:07:24	SN	Uh, how many points do you want us to plot? Three or four?
00:07:27	T	Well that's a very good question. Obviously, how many points do I really need to make a line?
00:07:31	S	Two.
00:07:32	T	Two. Right? But just to make sure-
00:07:34	S	Three.
00:07:35	T	Plot at least three points.
00:07:37	S	Okay.
00:07:38	T	That way if they're all in a line you know you did it right. Okay?
00:07:41	SN	Mr. Ormsby.
00:07:42	T	Yeah?
00:07:45	S	I made the graph.
00:07:46	T	Use the whole paper, man. Look at these big grid lines here. Everyone, make it count one. Okay?
00:07:53	S	Don't we have to use- use graph- graph every single one of those?
00:07:56	T	Yeah, you're going to graph these five. That's why I want you to use the whole paper. Make a big coordinate system.
00:08:00	S	Oh.
00:08:01	T	As a matter of fact- Let me give you a fresh one to save you some time.
00:08:02	S	Oh, okay.
00:08:05	SN	All right, now I get it.
00:08:08	SN	All right. So, we have to make one big, um-
00:08:12	T	Okay. So start over again.
00:08:15	T	Use the whole coordinate system, that way all the lines are nicely spaced out and everything.
00:08:18	SN	All right.
00:08:19	T	Okay?
00:08:20	S	We're out of (inaudible).
00:08:22	T	Okay, well how do you want to graph it? Using an X Y table?
00:08:26	S	Yeah.
00:08:27	T	Or do you want to learn how to use slope and Y intercept?
00:08:30	S	X Y table.
00:08:32	T	Okay. So you're gonna make a X Y table. Do you agree, Ben? All right.
00:08:40	T	See, if you work with Chris side-by-side, then you can compare answers. Right?
00:08:43	S	Mm hm.
00:08:44	T	Don't just rely on Chris here.
00:08:46	T	All right now, Chris, the idea is I'm gonna plug in any values I really want for X and figure out my corresponding Y. Okay?
00:08:54	T	But because this fraction is a two-thirds, what numbers should I possibly use that would make it easier for me?
00:09:01	S	Three.
00:09:02	T	Numbers based on three. So like maybe negative three, zero, three, six. Or zero, three, six, would be good enough, right?
00:09:09	S	Yeah.
00:09:10	T	That way you can get that graph down. Okay?
00:09:17	T	So, you need my help, or do you want to try it on your own first?
00:09:18	S	So... to input this X do I have to put this number?
00:09:21	T	All right, you ready?
00:09:24	T	Well, if you want, we don't have to do the negative. You want to do the negative?
00:09:31	S	Yeah.
00:09:31	T	Okay, here we go. Put a little negative three above there. Now you know I'm going to do two times negative three... is?
00:09:40	S	Negative six.
00:09:41	T	Divide by three is?
00:09:43	S	Neg- negative two.
00:09:44	T	Good. Plus eight.
00:09:46	S	Six.
00:09:47	T	Positive six.
00:09:49	S	Oh.
00:09:50	T	Right? Now you're going to put in a zero and do the same thing, right?
00:10:00	T	All right? There you go. See, with zero you don't even have to bother putting it in. Right?
00:10:04	T	You alr- you should already know that is your Y intercept. All right, try three. Now just make that a positive three.
00:10:11	T	That's it. You got it. You got it. Ben, see what Chris did there.
00:10:15	SN	All right.
00:10:16	T	All right?
00:10:18	T	Okay. All right sir, it looks like you're being left out here, aren't you?
00:10:25	SN	No.
00:10:26	T	Okay, you understand what they're doing?
00:10:27	S	We're using slope.
00:10:30	T	Okay. So all right, let me- let me test you here. Let's try number four. All right?
00:10:34	S	Okay, number four.
00:10:36	T	Okay. Oh by the way guys, I like how you labeled them, like that.
00:10:39	SN	Thanks.
00:10:40	T	Excellent job. X minus nine, right?
00:10:45	SN	Minus nine, okay.
00:10:46	T	So tell me how you would graph that?
00:10:49	S	I would-
00:10:51	T	Here we go.
00:10:53	S	I would go... negative nine. So, one, two, three, four, five.
00:10:59	T	Now that's negative nine for X.
00:11:01	S	Uh huh.
00:11:02	T	Right?
00:11:03	S	Mm hm.
00:11:04	T	That negative nine really is my Y intercept.
00:11:08	S	So then... I go down.
00:11:09	T	Ah ha.
00:11:10	S	One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10.
00:11:14	T	Good. Now we only want to go nine. Here you go. Hey, you guys taught him pretty well then, huh?
00:11:21	S	(inaudible)
00:11:22	T	And now my slope is one-fourth.
00:11:24	S	Uh huh.
00:11:25	T	So that means?
00:11:27	S	One- one, two, three, four.
00:11:32	T	Good job. Excellent job.
00:11:36	SN	Oh...
00:11:37	T	All right.
00:11:38	SN	(inaudible) times two is six. Negative six.
00:11:41	SN	All right this is seven, 10, 13, and 16 this time.
00:11:43	T	Okay.
00:11:44	SN	Is this right?
00:11:45	T	What's your question, Brandon?
00:11:46	SN	I don't even know how to do this.
00:11:49	S	I don't get it.
00:11:50	T	What about your partner here? She's doing an excellent job here.
00:11:53	S	Oh.
00:11:54	T	What, are you shy or something?
00:11:55	S	No, I just asked this guy and he said-
00:11:57	SN	I'm trying to do it too. I'm trying to figure this one out.
00:11:59	SN	Yeah, how do you do this?
00:12:01	T	Okay, let me go to this other group, guys. Brandon. Brandon. Do me a favor, all right?
00:12:10	T	I'll give you a choice, all right? You can pick either Ashley or Nick. Either way, I want- I want them to teach it to you. All right?
00:12:20	T	It's called teamwork here. Okay? All right. And if they can't do it, I'll be back in a few minutes to help you. All right?
00:12:27	SN	Mr. Ormsby, this is like the same thing as I did that one, right? That.
00:12:30	T	Okay. Let's take a look here.
00:12:31	SN	I mean, I know how to do this, but I don't know how to do the fractions.
00:12:35	T	I mean, a lot of these tables look great, now let's get them plotted here.
00:12:38	S	Okay.
00:12:39	T	And we can see what it comes out to be.
00:12:41	SN	So after we write them all down, we plot them on here?
00:12:41	T	Right.
00:12:42	S	Every single one?
00:12:43	T	Right. And then you're going to label them. Now if you-
00:12:46	T	If you don't mind, since this is equation one, just put a little one at the end of it. And equation two put a two at it- at the end of it. Okay?
00:12:53	S	All right.
00:12:54	T	Brandon, you had a comment? Question?
00:12:56	SN	I know how to do the regular ones. I don't know how to do the one with fractions. That's confusing.
00:13:00	SN	Those are the ones that I have trouble with.
00:13:01	SN	Was he- Were you listening when Mr. Ormsby was saying this?
00:13:02	T	Well, okay.
00:13:06	T	Well maybe you ought to go to Nick. Sounds like Nick knows what he's doing.
00:13:09	S	No, I said that I have trouble on it.
00:13:10	T	Okay, then maybe we ought to go to Ashley.
00:13:12	S	Nah, I could (inaudible).
00:13:14	T	Okay.
00:13:14	S	So you want- put-
00:13:15	T	Okay. What do we got going on here?
00:13:17	SN	We're done.
00:13:19	T	Sir?
00:13:20	SN	Well, we got done with all the (inaudible). We were going to call you but you were talking to them.
00:13:23	T	Trying to embarrass me here or something?
00:13:24	S	Of course not.
00:13:25	T	Uh huh.
00:13:25	S	You're really slow. For these ones here-
00:13:26	T	You're such a character, Nick.
00:13:28	S	For these- for the fractions we did the slope and then we made a table, and we're done.
00:13:32	T	And everybody agr- here agrees, right?
00:13:33	SN	Uh huh.
00:13:34	T	Okay. So let me just check them real quick. I like how you numbered them one, and so on.
00:13:41	T	This one you didn't number. What number is that one?
00:13:43	SN	Uh, I think that was five.
00:13:44	T	That was five. That one's correct, so put a five there. Okay, I can safely assume that this one must be the four, right?
00:13:44	SN	That was five.
00:13:53	S	Uh-
00:13:54	T	Or is this one the four? Which one's the four?
00:13:56	S	This one's two.
00:13:58	T	Which one's two?
00:13:59	SN	Four is this.
00:14:00	S	Four- four is negative nine, and up one is four.
00:14:01	SN	This one.
00:14:02	SN	So that- yeah, this is four.
00:14:04	T	Are you sure about that?
00:14:05	S	Yeah.
00:14:06	T	Because this one-
00:14:07	S	One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, and nine. Oh no. This is four.
00:14:11	T	Ah. Right.
00:14:13	S	This one's two.
00:14:14	T	So let- do me a favor. Erase the two, right, and label them right near the ends of the lines. How's that?
00:14:23	T	'Cause right there I can't tell which line you're talking about, right?
00:14:26	S	Right.
00:14:27	T	There I know. Hey two, that's that line. So this is the four line. Put the four right there. Okay? So both of those look excellent.
00:14:35	SN	Six minus (inaudible).
00:14:36	T	Slope of three-fifths and number four, slope of one-fourth. That's good.
00:14:41	T	Number one, slope with two-thirds starting at eight and this one is seven, right?
00:14:47	SN	Mm hm.
00:14:48	T	Uh oh. I don't like equation three because look, it's going down. That's a positive three X.
00:14:58	S	Oh.
00:14:59	T	It should be going-
00:15:00	S	Up.
00:15:01	T	It should be angling up. So correct number three, and then you guys- As soon as you get that corrected just move on.
00:15:05	T	I'll check that one later. Okay?
00:15:08	SN	Mr. Ormsby?
00:15:12	T	Here we go. Yeah?
00:15:13	S	We don't get number five.
00:15:15	T	Number five. All right, first of all, you know the Y intercept is what?
00:15:19	S	Negative five.
00:15:20	T	All right. So put a dot on negative five.
00:15:23	S	One, two, three, four, five.
00:15:26	T	Good. We all agree on that?
00:15:28	SS	Yes.
00:15:29	T	Now, this is something so simple but very important.
00:15:31	T	See in Algebra we get lazy sometimes, right? Guess what number is in front of that X.
00:15:37	SN	One.
00:15:38	SN	A one.
00:15:39	T	A one, right Robert? So therefore put a one there. If the slope is one, what am I going to do?
00:15:51	T	All right, you ready Sir? Make that one a- a fraction. How do I make one a fraction?
00:15:56	S	One over one.
00:15:57	T	One over one. Write it- write like- let's just put it underneath there. One over one. Something to look at. All right, that's fine.
00:16:03	T	Now remember slope is rise over run, right?
00:16:05	S	Mm hm.
00:16:06	T	So one over one means I rise one and I go across one.
00:16:11	S	There.
00:16:12	T	That's it. That's the slope of one. All right?
00:16:17	T	Just let me check them real quick.
00:16:22	T	All right. Now do me a favor, guys. You labeled these really nice. As a matter of fact, this is a way- an ideal way of labeling it.
00:16:29	T	Write the whole equation, but like for example, equation one right here, put a one next to it also.
00:16:36	T	And this one's equation three, right? So put a three next to that.
00:16:38	S	Okay.
00:16:39	T	So number them, in other words, okay?
00:16:41	S	Okay.
00:16:41	T	Because what that's going to do, that's going to help you when I ask these questions about each of the equations. Okay?
00:16:49	T	Because that's how I label them. I label them by numbers. Does that make sense? All right.
00:16:55	T	So as soon as you get that done, which you're almost done, you get them numbered, just move on to the next set of five.
00:17:01	S	Okay.
00:17:02	T	All right?
00:17:03	S	Yeah.
00:17:05	T	All right.
00:17:08	SN	So Y is three-fifths, X negative 10?
00:17:13	T	Okay. So wait a minute. You try- you're doing negative five, right?
00:17:16	S	Yeah.
00:17:17	T	Three times negative five is negative 15.
00:17:18	S	Negative 15.
00:17:20	T	Divided by five. Negative three. Minus 10?
00:17:24	S	Is, um, negative, um, seven- Oh, minus 10?
00:17:28	T	Negative three and a negative 10.
00:17:30	S	Oh, um, 13.
00:17:31	T	Negative 13. So let's change that.
00:17:34	S	Mm hm.
00:17:36	T	Well negative five is going to be, not five, but negative?
00:17:39	S	Thirteen.
00:17:40	T	Thirteen. All right? Ben, you look like you're not- you're just coasting here, man. What's going on?
00:17:47	SN	(inaudible)
00:17:52	T	Chris, make sure you help Ben out here, man. Ben- I just sense Ben's getting a little lost here.
00:17:58	T	All right, this is your chance to ask not only Chris, but also Raymond here. Get some help from them.
00:18:06	S	Okay.
00:18:08	T	You think you got it? Now zero of course is going to be what? If I put in zero here what am I going to get?
00:18:14	S	Uh- Zero.
00:18:17	T	Wait a minute, what's three-fifths times zero?
00:18:20	SN	Three-fifths times zero?
00:18:21	T	Zero. Minus 10 would be?
00:18:23	S	Ten. No.
00:18:25	T	Zero minus 10 would be?
00:18:28	S	Ten.
00:18:29	T	Not positive 10.
00:18:30	S	Negative 10.
00:18:31	T	Negative 10. So you want to put a negative 10 there. Okay?
00:18:34	S	Okay. So, oh.
00:18:37	T	Now try at least one more of five. Okay?
00:18:40	S	Uh, Isn't that, uh-
00:18:43	T	Now it's a positive five, right?
00:18:44	S	Yeah.
00:18:45	T	So it's going to be- Well, what's three times a positive five? Fifteen. Divided by five is?
00:18:51	S	Three.
00:18:52	T	Three minus 10.
00:18:54	S	Seven.
00:18:55	T	Negative seven. Don't forget the negative.
00:18:56	S	Negative seven.
00:18:57	S	Oh, all right.
00:18:58	T	Okay?
00:19:00	T	All right guys. Thanks for waiting so long.
00:19:01	SN	Okay.
00:19:02	T	All right, you want me to just check the answers?
00:19:03	SN	Yeah.
00:19:04	T	Now the only favor I need you to do, is because for each of these numbered equations, just number them. For example, this is one, correct?
00:19:12	SN	Yeah.
00:19:13	T	This one was equation three.
00:19:14	S	Yeah.
00:19:15	T	This one was equation five. So near the end of each of these arrows-
00:19:18	S	Yeah, put the number?
00:19:19	T	Just put- put the number.
00:19:21	T	And then this one, let me just make sure, because I don't have them all memorized.
00:19:26	T	Let's see, negative nine was one-fourth. You've got the slope perfect there and this one was three-fifths, right?
00:19:32	T	So everything looks perfect. Just number them and move on to the next five.
00:19:36	SS	Okay.
00:19:37	T	Okay?
00:19:38	SN	Mr. Ormsby?
00:19:41	S	We're on number six.
00:19:42	SN	I got it, guys. I got it.
00:19:43	SN	Check our answers.
00:19:44	SN	So here's all of number five.
00:19:45	T	Look at that excellent work, man. Excellent work.
00:19:47	SN	I crossed it out.
00:19:48	SN	There's one, there's two, there's three, and there's four and there's five.
00:19:51	SN	I figured it out.
00:19:52	T	Excellent.
00:19:53	SN	But it- they're having problems on number-
00:19:55	SN	Oh there it is. I found it. I found it. I- I- now I (inaudible) do.
00:19:58	T	Okay. You know what? As a matter of fact I think it's time for me to address the whole class.
00:20:02	SN	Okay.
00:20:03	T	Everybody. Ladies and gentlemen, listen up. Five, four, three, two, one, zero.
00:20:10	T	Now, about half of you are about ready to start the next set of five, right? Starting on number six?
00:20:16	SN	Yep, that's what we're doing. We're starting (inaudible).
00:20:18	T	Let me give you a hint. Just a little reminder, what you will notice-
00:20:24	T	Julie, you're doing a great job but please listen, okay?
00:20:26	T	You'll notice on equations six through 10 the slopes are negative. All right?
00:20:32	SN	Yep, all (inaudible).
00:20:33	T	So therefore, instead of rise over run meaning you'd go up and to the right, with the negative you're going to instead go, down and to the right.
00:20:44	T	Okay? Does that make sense to everybody?
00:20:47	SN	Yeah.
00:20:48	T	So please keep going. Please make sure I check your first five and give you the okay to move on. Okay?
00:20:52	SN	Could you check ours?
00:20:53	SN	All right.
00:20:54	T	Yeah.
00:20:55	S	Actually, I'm on four.
00:20:56	T	I'll check yours real quick. Okay. All right, good. You guys numbered them?
00:21:00	SN	Yeah.
00:21:01	SN	Yeah.
00:21:02	T	Okay. There's one, slope. Equation three, two-thirds. Equation five looks good.
00:21:10	SN	I haven't even gotten to five. I'm already-
00:21:11	T	Okay. Then you've got four and two. It looks perfect so far.
00:21:16	SN	Okay.
00:21:17	T	Move on to equation six then.
00:21:18	S	Okay.
00:21:19	T	Now you're saying you're being left behind here a little bit? On which one?
00:21:23	SN	Well, they're obviously on five and-
00:21:27	T	Okay.
00:21:28	S	We're on-
00:21:29	T	Now Robert, here, I'm sure can help you. You've got the- one of the smartest kids in class right here.
00:21:33	S	He's tried to explain it once, but I'm not so sure.
00:21:36	T	Okay. It looks like you made a nice table here, though. You understand what you did there?
00:21:40	S	Yeah.
00:21:41	T	Okay. So you- when you put in zero, one-fourth times zero is what?
00:21:45	S	Zero.
00:21:46	T	Minus nine is?
00:21:47	S	Negative nine.
00:21:48	T	Okay. Then you tried four, right?
00:21:51	S	Yeah.
00:21:52	T	All right. Why did you pick four and eight? Why didn't you pick like one and two and three? Numbers like that?
00:21:57	S	Because they're divisible by four.
00:22:00	T	Well said. Good job. So when I try four, see, what's one-fourth times four? Just one-
00:22:06	S	Yeah.
00:22:07	T	Minus nine is a negative eight.
00:22:09	S	Yeah.
00:22:10	T	And then you put an eight. One-fourth of eight is?
00:22:12	S	Two.
00:22:13	T	Minus nine is negative seven. So that's perfect. If you plot those three points you get exactly what is on your graph there. Okay?
00:22:20	SN	Can I see this really quick?
00:22:22	SN	Mr. Ormsby?
00:22:23	T	All right. Guys-
00:22:25	SN	Are you sure this is right? Because you're all-
00:22:27	T	Oh, so you want me to just check six real quick, right?
00:22:29	SN	And five.
00:22:30	SN	And five.
00:22:31	SN	Five, because that's the one we messed up on (inaudible).
00:22:33	T	Right. Five now looks perfect.
00:22:35	S	No three. Three was-
00:22:36	T	Oh, three was the one we messed up on. So three is right here and the idea is that you want a positive three slope, which you did perfectly.
00:22:44	S	All right.
00:22:45	T	So three is good. Let's go back to six since we're here.
00:22:50	T	Here's six, so you started at positive eight.
00:22:52	S	Yeah.
00:22:53	T	The slope is negative five-thirds so you went down five and over three, didn't you?
00:22:58	S	Yeah.
00:22:59	T	Perfect.
00:23:00	S	All right.
00:23:01	T	Okay?
00:23:04	T	Okay. Ashley, how is Brandon doing here?
00:23:07	SN	I'm helping him.
00:23:08	T	Brandon? Good. That's what I want to see.
00:23:10	SN	The rest- we're done. We just want you to check.
00:23:13	T	All right, you keep helping Brandon. Let me meet with Ashley over here. Nick, if you want to watch you can.
00:23:17	SN	Okey-dokey.
00:23:19	T	But I can tell you right now, five is good.
00:23:21	S	Okay. And you see the pattern in eight and 10? If I put- how many do you add for 10?
00:23:22	T	Okay? Let me start in order here. One looks good. Hold it. Wait a minute. Let me check one again.
00:23:29	S	Yeah, you've got to do 12.
00:23:30	T	One, the slope is two-thirds, isn't it? Right? So first of all our Y intercept is eight.
00:23:34	S	Wait- wait.
00:23:37	T	Ashley, let's look at yours since you're more comfortable with yours.
00:23:39	SN	Yeah.
00:23:40	T	You agree that zero, eight should be my first point, right?
00:23:43	S	Mm hm.
00:23:44	T	Two, four, six, eight. Okay. That's good.
00:23:47	S	Hold on Brandon.
00:23:49	T	Three-
00:23:50	SN	I made one over three. One, two, three.
00:23:52	T	Oh, here's your mistake.
00:23:54	SN	Yep, Jessie.
00:23:55	T	All right? Now watch Ashley, you ready? When I put in three, two times the three would be six-
00:24:03	S	Six. Oh yeah.
00:24:04	T	Divided by three would make?
00:24:06	S	Two.
00:24:09	T	Two. Six divided by three is two, right?
00:24:10	S	I know it's two.
00:24:11	T	Okay, plus eight would make, 10. So three would be 10; well what's two plus eight? Ten.
00:24:18	T	So if that's a 10, this one I'm sure has got to be something bigger. Okay?
00:24:23	SN	Eleven. Twelve?
00:24:25	SN	This may be 12.
00:24:26	T	I believe it's 12.
00:24:27	S	Yeah, see I did it on here, but I did it wrong on my paper.
00:24:29	T	Okay.
00:24:29	S	It's weird.
00:24:30	T	All right, so it sounds like you guys didn't compare your answers here but I think that's your only mistake.
00:24:39	T	Because equation three looks very good. All right.
00:24:43	T	You know what? Equation two I don't necessarily like either. Is this supposed to be two?
00:24:50	T	Two says we're starting at what number?
00:24:52	SN	Negative 10.
00:24:53	T	Negative 10, right? You're not starting at negative 10 here. What's this number?
00:24:57	T	Two, four- somehow you're starting at negative six. So what happened on equation two, guys?
00:25:06	T	Hey, how come we didn't use your table?
00:25:08	SN	I don't know. We were looking at his.
00:25:10	SN	Okay. So if we start at 10, then-
00:25:13	T	Oh, I know- Look what you did wrong. You copied the equation down wrong.
00:25:17	S	That's number four.
00:25:19	T	Oh, I'm sorry. You're right. My mistake.
00:25:22	S	Oh yeah, it does start at six.
00:25:24	T	I can't even read your writing. Yeah, why is that a six? That should be a negative 10, right?
00:25:27	S	It looks like a six but it's 10.
00:25:28	T	Okay. And five you got negative seven.
00:25:30	S	Yeah.
00:25:31	T	I agree with that.
00:25:32	S	Yeah.
00:25:33	T	Okay, and then 10 you got negative four.
00:25:37	T	Okay, so why don't you try re-plotting those three points and move on to equation six through 10 and I'll check on number two later on.
00:25:47	T	Okay, the rest of them look pretty good, though. All right?
00:25:49	S	All right.
00:25:50	SN	Mr. Ormsby, whoo-hoo.
00:25:52	T	Okay, what are we doing here, guys? Hey, how come none of these lines are labeled?
00:25:57	SN	Whoops.
00:25:58	T	Now what I suggest you do-
00:25:59	S	(inaudible) two lines.
00:26:00	T	Hold on. What I suggest you do before I come back is for each of these- just call it equation one, two, three, four, and five, right?
00:26:08	T	Put a number at the end of each of these lines.
00:26:13	S	Oh, like number one, two, three-
00:26:14	T	Like for example, number one- Uh oh. Wait a minute. I don't like what I see here.
00:26:23	S	Look what you made me do. You probably thought of it wrong.
00:26:24	T	Okay. Let's see here. Number one, I believe this is supposed to be your number one here, right?
00:26:33	S	I think so.
00:26:34	SN	I don't know.
00:26:35	T	How come it's going down, guys?
00:26:36	SN	I don't know, it does it.
00:26:38	T	Aren't all these slopes positive? So all of these should be going up.
00:26:42	SN	How's it going down?
00:26:44	T	Look at it. It's going down.
00:26:46	S	It's going up.
00:26:47	T	How do you read a book? How do you read a book, sir?
00:26:48	S	Left to right.
00:26:49	T	You read from left to right. So let's start on the left side of the line.
00:26:52	S	Yeah.
00:26:53	T	And as I move to the right I'm going in which direction?
00:26:56	S	Down.
00:26:57	T	Right. Now if you look at all the other lines, see they're all positive.
00:27:00	S	But it's going up.
00:27:02	T	Sir you have to read from left to right. Okay? All right.
00:27:07	SN	It's going down like that.
00:27:08	T	So, guys, you need to make those corrections. Label the line. Correct this one, at least.
00:27:12	S	How come we've never done this before?
00:27:13	T	Okay?
00:27:13	SN	You made me do it (inaudible).
00:27:14	SN	Could you check our answers for (inaudible).
00:27:16	T	Oh my gosh. Let me make sure I keep track of the time, too. All right.
00:27:22	T	Hey you guys did an awesome job here. Okay. Let's take a look here. So here's your number six right?
00:27:29	SN	Uh huh.
00:27:31	T	And you started at eight and the slope was negative five-thirds so you went down five and over three.
00:27:37	S	Uh huh.
00:27:39	T	That line looks perfect. Let's look at your number seven. Here's negative one. You went down four and over one.
00:27:47	T	There's your line there. That looks perfect. Let's check number eight real quick.
00:27:52	SN	All right, I think I did it kinda-
00:27:54	T	Oh, that's the eight, right? Okay? So on number eight you started at 12 and negative one-third. Looks perfect.
00:28:03	T	Number nine is 14, which is where?
00:28:06	SN	It's all the way up here.
00:28:07	T	Way at the very top. And negative three-halves means you went down three and over two, so there's your line right there.
00:28:16	T	And finally number 10, we're at three, the slope is negative one. Perfect.
00:28:21	SN	Cool.
00:28:22	T	So now, all you guys have to do-
00:28:25	SN	Answer the questions.
00:28:26	T	Is to answer these questions. Okay? The best you can.
00:28:29	SN	On this piece of paper?
00:28:31	T	On your piece of paper, okay?
00:28:32	S	Okay.
00:28:32	T	On your own piece of paper.
00:28:33	S	Okay.
00:28:36	T	All right, how we doing here, guys?
00:28:37	SN	I don't know (inaudible).
00:28:40	T	What's the ruler for?
00:28:41	S	Oh.
00:28:43	T	Look at this. Just from now on make sure- straighten out these lines and keep going.
00:28:49	S	All right.
00:28:50	T	And are you labeling? That's number one-
00:28:50	S	Yeah.
00:28:53	T	Number two.
00:28:53	S	No that's number three. I forgot to do number two.
00:28:55	T	Okay, wait a minute. Number three is concerning me. You ready?
00:28:58	S	Yeah.
00:28:59	T	Let's try this again real quick. All right. It's three X plus seven, right?
00:29:03	S	Yeah.
00:29:04	T	So when I put in- Let's- let's just start with zero. When I put in zero, what's three times zero?
00:29:08	S	Zero.
00:29:09	T	Plus seven is?
00:29:10	S	Seven.
00:29:11	T	Why did you put negative seven? What's zero plus seven?
00:29:15	S	Well I started- Oh.
00:29:17	T	Chris, let me take a look at your table for three.
00:29:20	T	How come you're not standing up to Raymond here and saying, hey man, look I got the right answers.
00:29:27	T	All right, your table is correct. You've got to believe in yourself. All right?
00:29:28	SN	I didn't know it was right.
00:29:30	T	You guys gotta start working better together and comparing answers. All right?
00:29:36	T	Ben, I'm worried about you man. What are we doing here.
00:29:38	T	Put away the book.
00:29:39	SN	Okay.
00:29:40	T	And Chris, you need to work with your normal partner here a little bit better. And compare answers.
00:29:47	T	So I mean, if you would have compared answers, guys, you would have seen on this table here, right-
00:29:54	T	That, hey! Someone must be making a mistake because we're getting different answers here, right?
00:29:57	SN	Mm hm.
00:29:59	T	So, either correct yours, or if you want, you can trust Chris. I would trust Chris- Chris' to be honest.
00:30:06	S	All right.
00:30:07	T	Okay.
00:30:08	SN	I used twos... (inaudible) threes.
00:30:10	T	Right. Now did you have to go by twos?
00:30:12	S	I- I don't- did I?
00:30:15	T	Well wait a minute. Isn't this just a regular number three?
00:30:18	SN	Yeah.
00:30:19	SN	Yeah.
00:30:20	T	So on these kind, I always told you just use, like, zero, one and two, right?
00:30:23	T	You didn't have to go by multiples or anything because there's no fraction to divide by. You see?
00:30:29	T	All right guys, let's see what we can do here.
00:30:31	SN	Mr. Ormsby? All right, never mind.
00:30:35	T	Okay. Can I interrupt the whole class? Shh.
00:30:40	T	Okay.
00:30:41	SN	I guess.
00:30:42	T	Five, four, three, two, one, zero. Shh. Now please listen. Okay?
00:30:47	T	The thing is I- I have to be honest.
00:30:51	T	I'm getting a little- a little worried, maybe a little frustrated here, just because I could see that some of you have some serious weaknesses.
00:30:59	T	Yet, you have people either across from you or right next to you, your own partner that seems most of the time,
00:31:08	T	have the right answers, yet you're not even asking them.
00:31:12	T	So, guys, I ask you, starting right now, is check your work with your partner's work. Work together.
00:31:19	T	All right, this is not an individual kind of assignment here. Does everything I say make sense so far?
00:31:25	SN	Yes Mr. Ormsby.
00:31:26	T	Okay. Now let me just give you a heads up. We've got roughly what? Twelve minutes left in class?
00:31:34	SN	Um, (inaudible).
00:31:34	T	Okay. I want you to keep doing what you're doing. If for whatever reason you actually get to the last page-
00:31:41	SN	Yeah, we are at there.
00:31:42	T	And you- you've answered these questions to the best of your ability- Now obviously today we have no time to discuss it, okay.
00:31:48	T	We're going to pick up- we're going to pick this up again on Monday, but if you happen to ask these questions-
00:31:53	SN	Monday?
00:31:56	T	Yeah, we're back on Monday, right?
00:31:58	SN	Yeah.
00:31:59	T	When we- when we- after you answer these questions, if you get that far, please make sure you do this "quickwrite".
00:32:08	T	All right. Which simply means all I want you to do is be honest with yourself and with me and just sit there for the remaining time.
00:32:15	T	Write a minimum of two paragraphs, okay, on what we've learned today. What you've actually learned today. Okay?
00:32:25	T	Those of you that aren't at this stage, don't worry about it yet.
00:32:28	T	At about, let's say, four or five minutes, I'm going to make all of you do it anyways.
00:32:32	SN	You're so generous, Mr. Ormsby.
00:32:33	T	So please keep working wherever you are. I'm still walking around.
00:32:38	T	Yeah?
00:32:39	SN	(inaudible)
00:32:41	T	Don't worry about that until Monday. We'll catch up on Monday. All right. Let's focus on this.
00:32:43	SN	We got done and we (inaudible) like- where's the paper at?
00:32:47	SN	Right there.
00:32:48	T	All right, Ashley?
00:32:50	SN	Yeah, um- Okay, I don't get these two.
00:32:55	T	All right. Does anyone in this group-
00:32:57	SS	No.
00:32:58	T	Understand what to do here?
00:32:59	SN	No. Because, like, there's different numbers. Which one would we use?
00:33:01	T	Okay. All right. Okay. Now you want to use slope and Y intercept or do you want to make tables?
00:33:08	S	Tables.
00:33:09	T	Seems like tables are the way to go here, right?
00:33:11	S	Yeah.
00:33:11	T	So let's- let's go there, all right? First of all, Ashley, that's a negative five-thirds, isn't it?
00:33:17	SN	Oh.
00:33:18	SN	Wait- No- the fastest-
00:33:19	T	Okay. So now, if I plug in zero, guys- Brandon, watch. If I plug in zero, what's negative five-thirds times zero?
00:33:28	S	Zero.
00:33:29	T	Plus eight is?
00:33:30	S	Eight.
00:33:31	T	All right. That was easy.
00:33:33	S	But I don't know what to use. Like threes?
00:33:35	T	You would use threes. Try three and six. Okay?
00:33:40	SN	My stomach's hurting. Can I get a drink of water?
00:33:43	T	Sir, no. You have to stay here. All right? So- all right, let's try three. Nick, Jessie, you ready?
00:33:49	SN	Two- 10.
00:33:50	T	If I put in a three there, okay-
00:33:54	S	It's going to be five, right?
00:33:55	T	You're going to get negative five because the negative plus eight. What's negative five plus eight?
00:34:00	S	Negative- Oh yeah.
00:34:02	T	Positive three.
00:34:03	S	Wait, (inaudible) is negative two.
00:34:04	SN	Wait, is that how you do three?
00:34:05	T	Well you wrote it upside down. That's okay. And then the next one is going to be what?
00:34:09	SN	Negative two.
00:34:10	T	It's going to be negative two. You got it.
00:34:12	S	Oh.
00:34:13	T	(inaudible) two.
00:34:15	S	Oh no. I (inaudible).
00:34:16	T	Okay, you haven't done- You did that in your head, huh?
00:34:17	S	Yeah.
00:34:17	T	Impressive.
00:34:18	S	I always do my work in my head.
00:34:19	T	Okay. So don't let the negatives scare you. Just the same idea as the front.
00:34:24	T	Just know that when you times, you've got to have a negative, right, in your problem. That's all.
00:34:31	S	All right.
00:34:33	T	Why do you keep getting out of your seat, Robert?
00:34:34	SN	Well, I have to (inaudible).
00:34:35	T	I'm coming to-
00:34:36	T	Okay, I just kind of noticed out of the corner of my eye. So what's going on here, how we doing?
00:34:40	SN	Okay. We're doing fine.
00:34:44	T	Okay? So have I come by to check all 10 equations yet?
00:34:49	S	No not yet, we're just- We're on number 10.
00:34:50	SN	Not all 10. Just the first five.
00:34:51	SN	We're on number 10.
00:34:52	T	Okay. You are on number 10. You want me to wait until you get number 10 done?
00:34:55	SN	Yeah.
00:34:56	SN	Yeah.
00:34:57	T	Okay. All right.
00:34:59	SN	Why did I get it wrong- oh, I didn't write it.
00:35:00	T	Ladies, you've been awful quiet over here. What's going on?
00:35:03	SN	Well, because we've been waiting for you?
00:35:04	T	Okay, all right.
00:35:05	SN	For like a century.
00:35:07	T	So where are you stuck? Or if you're not stuck, what would like me- Do you want me to just check your answers then?
00:35:12	SN	Yeah.
00:35:13	T	Is that what you're saying?
00:35:14	S	Yeah.
00:35:15	T	Okay. So- So I've already checked the first five? Yes or no?
00:35:21	SN	No.
00:35:22	SN	No.
00:35:23	T	Oh, really?
00:35:24	S	Well, because you've been over there, you know-
00:35:26	T	Yeah, I know. I've been pretty busy. All right, let's start with six through 10.
00:35:29	SN	Well, we're only on eight.
00:35:30	T	So- Okay, so I'll do- I'll do the first eight, how's that?
00:35:33	S	First eight- Okay.
00:35:36	T	All right. So I agree, that's plus 12. Wait a minute, which one are we doing? Number six.
00:35:41	T	That's plus eight, right? Two, four, six, eight. Good.
00:35:44	T	Now negative five-thirds would mean you come down five and you go over three, right? So that one's perfect.
00:35:50	T	Number seven. You would have started at negative one and because of the negative four slope you would have gone down four and over one.
00:35:53	SN	Number three.
00:35:58	T	So that one is perfect.
00:36:00	S	And number three?
00:36:01	T	Okay. And number eight, I'm a little concerned. See how it's slanting up? See, eight's a negative one-third.
00:36:08	SN	Yeah, but that's a plus 12.
00:36:09	T	So are you ready? Well what does plus 12 mean? Up here. So erase number eight. Try number eight again. Okay?
00:36:20	S	(inaudible)
00:36:22	T	Okay. All right, wait a minute Jessica- All right, let me slow down, then. Because trust me, I'm sick and I'm also tired but we-
00:36:28	T	We can do this, all right. You ready?
00:36:31	SN	Zero, three, and six is right, though, right?
00:36:33	T	Zero was 12. So why did you plot down here, when zero positive 12 is up there.
00:36:38	S	Oh, I made a mistake.
00:36:42	T	Okay, let's look at the rest of your table.
00:36:44	S	I put a negative.
00:36:46	T	So three. All right, if I put a three here, DeCarlos, what's one-third of three?
00:36:52	SN	Um, one.
00:36:54	T	One, right? So that negative makes it a negative one plus 12, which was a positive- So you had these points exactly right.
00:36:59	SN	I check- I put them backwards.
00:37:00	T	So you put them down- you plotted wrong, basically, right?
00:37:03	S	Yeah.
00:37:03	T	All right.
00:37:05	SN	Mr. Ormsby?
00:37:07	T	Okay, all right. Yes? You're finally done, right?
00:37:10	SN	Yes.
00:37:11	T	Okay. If you don't mind I'll just take a quick glance. Spot-check a few of them because I'd like you to move on to the questions.
00:37:19	SN	Okay.
00:37:20	SN	All right.
00:37:21	T	Start answering the questions. Okay?
00:37:22	T	And the ones I'm looking at right now, like for example, this one here this is number seven. That looks good.
00:37:27	T	Number six, five over three, that looks perfect. Okay. Oh, let me see. You just finished 10, right?
00:37:35	SN	Mm hm.
00:37:35	T	And that one's also perfect. So I can safely say that you guys seem to know what you're doing. So now please answer these questions. All right?
00:37:44	SN	That's a lot of questions.
00:37:45	T	For example- Well, just go one by one. You're going to have more time on Monday anyway.
00:37:48	S	All right.
00:37:49	T	But on number one, what- what did you notice about the first five equations? When you graphed them what did you honestly notice about them all?
00:37:56	SN	They all had a slope.
00:37:57	SN	They all went to the right.
00:37:59	T	They all went up and to the right.
00:38:00	SN	Yeah.
00:38:01	T	They had a-
00:38:02	T	That's why we always said they had a positive slope because the positive number in front of X, all right? Okay.
00:38:03	SN	Yeah, they were positive.
00:38:09	T	All right, ladies and gentlemen. Shh. Listen up.
00:38:14	T	Wherever you are- wherever you are, honestly guys, it really doesn't matter.
00:38:20	T	I really appreciate the effort you put in for me today. That's the important thing.
00:38:24	T	What I'd like you to do-
00:38:28	T	What I'd like you to do now, whether you're done or not guys, I honestly hope that all of you have learned something today. Okay?
00:38:36	T	So I want everyone now, on their own piece of paper- I repeat, on your own piece of paper-
00:38:43	T	Do this quickwrite for the remaining part of the class.
00:38:47	SN	On that same piece of paper.
00:38:48	T	And a few hints would be like, hey did you learn- did you understand?
00:38:52	T	Did you understand something about slope maybe a little bit better?
00:38:54	SN	Same paper?
00:38:56	T	Or Y intercepts.
00:38:57	S	Same paper.
00:38:58	T	Or maybe you got better at making tables. On the same piece of paper, yes sir. Any questions on that?
00:39:05	T	All right, quickwrite time guys. Let's get that done.
00:39:10	SN	Can you check these?
00:39:11	T	What's this skull and bones stuff?
00:39:13	SN	Don't know.
00:39:14	SN	Nice drawing.
00:39:15	T	Jeremy? Oh, you're waiting for me because we're done over here?
00:39:18	S	Yeah.
00:39:19	SN	Yeah.
00:39:20	T	Let me- let me see wh- Let me see the answers.
00:39:23	S	They're over here.
00:39:24	SN	(inaudible)
00:39:26	T	Okay. But where's your own work, Dell?
00:39:31	S	(inaudible)
00:39:32	SN	I didn't know it was-
00:39:33	T	And right now what are you supposed to be doing?
00:39:34	S	I was doing that. He was doing this.
00:39:35	T	I understand, but right now what are you supposed to be doing?
00:39:37	SN	We were waiting for you.
00:39:39	T	All right. Now that I'm here, what else could you be doing right now? What did I talk about on the board there?
00:39:43	S	This. Quickwrite.
00:39:44	SN	The quickwrite.
00:39:46	T	All right. See, I can see quickly you haven't even finished graphing these yet, so I want you to do the quickwrite right now.
00:39:52	T	And then I expect better results on Monday. I want you to finish this up on Monday. Fair enough? Okay Jeremy?
00:40:00	SN	Mr. Ormsby? Number six, it says, what do you notice about the intersection between-
00:40:05	T	Ah, see now it gets a little interesting. Show me your equation two.
00:40:09	S	Two is uh, down here.
00:40:11	T	Show me your equation six. Now, one thing that hopefully you understand is- See a line-
00:40:18	T	Those arrows mean they go on- lines go on forever in both directions, right.
00:40:21	S	Oh yeah.
00:40:22	T	So take your ruler... and let's ext- actually extend this line. Be very careful. Be precise.
00:40:29	T	Let's extend that line straight down. Okay. Go all the way down to there somewhere. There you go.
00:40:40	T	Good. Good. Good. Good. Now, that's good enough because the idea is, I'm asking about what? The intersection.
00:40:49	T	An intersection is where two lines-
00:40:51	S	Meet.
00:40:52	SN	Meet.
00:40:53	T	Meet or cross each other, right? Look where these two lines meet or cross. What do you notice about the angles there?
00:41:00	SN	It's a right angle.
00:41:02	T	Well said. Right? So now in mathematics, this is something I haven't mentioned yet, that's also called perpendicular.
00:41:10	T	Have you guys heard about that before?
00:41:11	S	Yeah.
00:41:12	T	So these two lines, therefore you would say are? Perpendicular. They make right angles. Right?
00:41:19	S	Mm hm.
00:41:21	SN	My pencil.
00:41:25	SN	Hi Mr. Ormsby.
00:41:26	SN	I screwed up on graph nine and-
00:41:27	T	Okay.
00:41:29	SN	He's all-
00:41:34	T	Have you started your quickwrite yet Brittany?
00:41:36	SN	No, because I was doing the graphing and Nathan has all the answers, so I have to write down all the answers.
00:41:41	T	Right now I want you to stop what you're doing and let's just say one paragraph now. Just write as much as you can.
00:41:49	S	I didn't learn anything.
00:41:50	T	All right.
00:41:52	T	You didn't learn- you didn't know how- learn how to make tables or understand slope or Y intercept or anything like that? Okay?
00:42:14	SN	I said (inaudible) graph, I'm not gonna do it because I got messed up on the, um-
00:42:16	SN	It looks nice. That looks nice.
00:42:18	SN	On the-
00:42:19	T	How come you crumpled it up?
00:42:20	SN	Because I messed up.
00:42:21	T	Oh, so you got a new one?
00:42:22	S	Yeah.
00:42:23	T	So on Monday you're going to redo it.
00:42:24	S	I'm- I'm just trying to-
00:42:25	T	Maybe even use a ruler to draw your coordinate system. Make it look professional.
00:42:29	SN	Yeah.
00:42:30	SN	Do it all the way down.
00:42:31	SN	Over on your weekend.
00:42:32	T	Okay.
00:42:35	SN	I'm not going to be here.
00:42:36	T	Okay.
00:42:37	SN	We're getting our work done here, look.
00:42:40	T	Last time ladies and gentlemen. Five, four, three, two, one, zero.
00:42:47	T	Okay. Here's the deal.
00:42:50	T	Because we're running short on time and since I'm going to follow up anyways on Monday, okay-
00:42:58	T	And we're actually going to have a little discussion about not just graphing but also what I wanted you to discover about these lines, all right.
00:43:07	T	Please make sure you put away all your work. Do not lose any of it.
00:43:13	SN	Where are we-
00:43:13	T	Do not turn in anything today because you're going to need it all Monday.
00:43:15	S	What do we do- What do we do with this?
00:43:18	T	Can I trust you- can your group trust you to fold that up and put it away somewhere?
00:43:21	SN	Nope.
00:43:22	SN	(inaudible) in your backpack.
00:43:23	T	All right.
00:43:24	SN	What do we do with these?
00:43:26	T	Keep it until Monday. Okay?
00:43:28	SN	Keep it till Monday in your backpack because if I take it, I'm going to lose it.
00:43:32	T	Okay.
00:43:33	SN	Mr. Ormsby, I'm not going to be here all next weekend.
00:43:37	S	Or all next week, 'cause we're going up to Seattle for um, Thanksgiving.
00:43:41	T	Okay.
00:43:42	S	And I'm gonna be (inaudible)-
00:43:43	T	You're le- You're not even going to be here Monday, Tuesday or Wednesday?
00:43:45	S	No, 'cause (inaudible).
00:43:46	SN	D-O-G.
00:43:47	SN	D- Cat. C-A-T.
00:43:50	T	Okay.
00:43:51	SN	I will- I'll be back um, on the-
00:43:53	T	Leave your work with another group member then.
00:43:54	SN	Hey, what do we do with this, Mr. Ormsby?
00:43:56	T	Leave that on the desk. That will be fine. Okay, hurry up and go guys. Have a good weekend.
00:44:01	SN	You too.
00:44:02	SN	Wait, Mr. Ormsby. I'm taking off.
00:44:07	SN	That was fun.
00:44:08	T	Did you have fun? Good.
00:44:09	SN	No.
00:44:11	SN	I had a blast.
00:44:12	SN	But I actually learned something without goofing off.
