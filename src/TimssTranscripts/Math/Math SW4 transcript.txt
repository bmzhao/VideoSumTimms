00:00:04	O	[Bell]
00:00:08	T	Okay, then.
00:00:16	T	Okay, then, hello take a seat. So to start with, we are going to correct the problems that were due for today, that means exercise 948...
00:00:28	T	Or we can practice one of the theorems of equivalence.
00:00:36	T	Especially this one which, in the first place, is the one which tells us that one must add up an expression. Therefore, page 948.
00:00:48	T	We will start nicely, we will start with Gregoire... With A, X plus five equals eight.
00:00:55	SN	Well, we must take away five.
00:00:57	T	We do minus five.
00:00:58	S	We do minus five, therefore X is equal to three.
00:00:59	T	Mmm.
00:01:01	T	X is equal to three. Okay? We will maybe do the most complicated ones on the board, the ones from the second line. For, er, the B.
00:01:11	T	Guillaume.
00:01:12	SN	Er, X plus three is equal to minus five. We must take away er... minus three.
00:01:17	T	So we mustn't take away minus three.
00:01:19	S	It makes minus three.
00:01:20	T	So we must add minus three or do minus three.
00:01:22	S	It makes minus three.
00:01:23	T	It makes minus three.
00:01:24	S	And X is equal to eight, to minus eight
00:01:27	T	To minus eight, X equals minus eight. Questions up until now? C? Er... Florence.
00:01:35	SN	Er, X minus six equals 30. Therefore we do plus six, which means X equals 36.
00:01:40	T	X equals 36, exactly... Letter D? Katia.
00:01:48	SN	Er... well er, the solution is five.
00:01:52	T	Uh huh, the solution is five. What do you do? That's what interests us. Now that we are learning what to do, what do you do?
00:01:59	S	Well-
00:02:00	T	We know that in an equation, we must put a little vertical bar, and what must we do?
00:02:07	T	What do we do to make our equation equivalent.
00:02:08	S	I did three times five. The first is 15, then the second is two times five plus five.
00:02:13	T	So there you're groping about.
00:02:15	S	Yeah.
00:02:16	T	You're searching like this- The idea is to do what? It's to avoid all these stories of groping about.
00:02:22	T	When we have an equation of this sort... it's the... We have three X is equal to two X plus five. What does that mean?
00:02:33	T	What's the basic idea in all these problems there? Herve?
00:02:36	SN	To take away the X's.
00:02:38	T	Take away the X. Here we must take away the X, but what are we trying to do? What are we trying to do as a final aim? Yes?
00:02:45	SN	(inaudible) X is equal to something.
00:02:47	T	X is equal. So we must put on one side the X's, on the other side whatever doesn't have any X's. So we have the theorems of equivalence that we saw.
00:02:55	T	There's one which says I can add or take away a number... Okay?
00:03:03	T	There's one that says I can add or take away expressions, some literal part, okay?
00:03:10	T	And then there's a third one where we can multiply by a number that is not equal to zero. Are we okay?
00:03:16	T	So here, what do we do? Valentine?
00:03:19	SN	We do minus two X.
00:03:21	T	We do minus two X.
00:03:22	S	Well there it stays one X to the three X.
00:03:25	T	On the left side it stays as one X. Three X minus two X makes one X.
00:03:28	S	(inaudible) the two X and then, er-
00:03:30	T	It suppresses the two X and what stays?
00:03:31	S	What stays is X is equal to plus five.
00:03:34	T	It stays as X is equal to plus five, and then directly one can say to oneself, well yes, my solution is well... five... Are we okay?
00:03:38	S	(inaudible)
00:03:44	T	Okay, Katia? Because if you try by doing it by groping about, I know that we did it, er, by successive tests-
00:03:53	T	We tried that, but we saw it was tedious and long. So now we have a new method.
00:03:59	T	Aurore, what can we say for E?
00:04:01	SN	We do minus four X.
00:04:03	T	We have five X is equal to minus eight plus four X. Therefore we do minus four X. Which gives us X equal to?
00:04:08	S	Minus eight...
00:04:09	T	X equals minus eight... Questions up until now? For F? For F maybe I'll write it up... We have minus eight X is equal to minus nine X... plus seventeen.
00:04:26	T	We will come to this side. Yeah, Herve.
00:04:28	SN	Well, er, since we want to eliminate the eight, well since we want to find X, we put, we do plus eight X.
00:04:36	T	So if we do plus eight X... What happens if we do plus eight X?
00:04:41	S	Ha, yeah...
00:04:43	T	We will have everything, we'll have nothing, and then we'll have the X's and the numbers on the right side. Have we won?
00:04:50	SS	(inaudible)
00:04:50	T	It's not want we want? What do we want?
00:04:53	SN	Well-
00:04:53	SN	There should be one X.
00:04:54	T	So, Camille?
00:04:55	SN	Nine X.
00:04:56	T	We do plus nine X. In doing plus nine X- in doing plus nine X what's interesting is that here we have X, because plus nine X minus eight X-
00:05:05	SN	It makes X.
00:05:05	T	It makes X is equal to?
00:05:08	SS	Seventeen.
00:05:08	T	Seventeen... and then directly one can have our solution which is, well, 17. So it's clear that sometimes we are going to try and get the X's.
00:05:18	T	There it's advantageous, we always have the X's on the left.
00:05:22	T	Maybe for G and H still, we'll put them up on the blackboard. So for G we have three X plus five... is, is equal to two X, Ludivine?
00:05:31	SN	Minus (inaudible).
00:05:32	T	Minus?
00:05:32	S	Minus 30.
00:05:33	T	Minus 30?
00:05:34	S	Yeah.
00:05:35	T	Okay... so we can do it all in one stage.
00:05:38	SS	No.
00:05:40	T	So one could- but one can do it in two... So what do we want to do first?
00:05:45	SS	(inaudible)
00:05:47	SN	Minus two.
00:05:47	T	So we want to do minus two X. And then it gives us?
00:05:50	SS	(inaudible)
00:05:51	SN	X plus five (inaudible).
00:05:52	T	X plus five is equal to?
00:05:55	SS	Minus three.
00:05:55	T	Minus three... and what do we want to do now? What's bothering us?
00:05:59	SS	Minus five.
00:06:00	T	It's the five which is bothering us, therefore we do...
00:06:02	SS	Minus five.
00:06:03	T	Minus five. Therefore X is equal to?
00:06:05	SS	Minus 35.
00:06:06	T	Minus 35. Okay... But we're going to try and take in the next one, we're going to try and do it in one stage directly. When
00:06:15	T	we write the next one down, we have 18 X. It's H... We have eighteen X, er, minus 24.
00:06:22	SS	(inaudible)
00:06:25	T	Plus 17 X... There we're going to try and do it in one stage. I don't have enough space. It's going to be okay. Eighteen X minus 24 is equal to
00:06:33	T	72 plus 17 X... What do you want to do? What must we choose first?
00:06:42	SS	Minus 17.
00:06:43	T	So minus 17 X. It means we've chosen that on the right side we had more X's. We're okay? Okay, so if we decide to write minus
00:06:50	T	17 X without doing the operation, we say- well then. I have already decided that on the right there would be more X's and then I'll put them on the left.
00:06:58	T	Are we okay? On the left the X's... So on the right we only have the-
00:07:02	SN	The numbers.
00:07:03	T	Okay. So what is bothering us on the left now? It's-
00:07:09	SS	Minus 24.
00:07:10	T	The minus 24. Therefore what must I do to take away this minus 24?
00:07:13	SS	Plus 24.
00:07:14	T	Plus 24. Therefore I can directly write at the same time plus 24... and I do the two things at the same time.
00:07:21	T	What I'm going to be able to do, we shall see in the following exercises, it's to do multiplications and additions at the same time. But on the other hand...
00:07:29	T	Plus if I add up, instead of adding up monomials, if I add up polynomials, it's the same thing. Since I add up several
00:07:36	T	monomials. Okay? Therefore the 18 X that I'm going to subtract minus 17 X, there's going to stay?
00:07:42	S	X.
00:07:43	T	And then what am I going to do with my 24? Well, the minus 24? I'll be staying with the Y. The seven- the
00:07:56	T	minus 17 X, when it will arrive here, it will make the 17 X go away. And then the 24, when it arrives here it will
00:08:03	T	give me? Ninety-six.
00:08:10	T	And there we don't need a calculator to get to that S is equal to 96. Is there a question on this exercise 948?
00:08:18	T	So I'll let you continue with 949.
00:08:23	T	For those who finish through 950, there's 951, 952, 953,
00:08:32	T	954. There's enough to amuse oneself until 957.
00:09:22	S	Sir?
00:09:23	T	Yes.
00:09:24	S	(inaudible) 949, I don't need to (inaudible).
00:09:30	T	But you've done it right here.
00:09:32	S	But yes, but A, we did with you.
00:09:34	T	Ah! So?
00:09:38	S	And, er, here B.
00:09:39	T	Yeah, you want to isolate- you want to isolate what?
00:09:44	S	Er, I- yeah, but I haven't understood.
00:09:46	T	But you want to isolate what, and you want to keep what? You decided on the left you put X's? It's what you've decided there. You tried to do
00:09:53	T	this. What's bothering you? It's that one there.
00:09:55	S	Yeah, therefore I do minus.
00:09:58	T	No. How do you take away seven? How do you get minus seven to become zero?
00:10:04	S	Er, I do plus- plus eight... er! Plus seven.
00:10:10	T	You do plus seven, hum. You take- so do plus seven. So now what happens on that side there? I do plus seven,
00:10:17	T	two X minus seven plus seven. The two X's will stay there.
00:10:21	S	Two X is equal to seven.
00:10:22	T	And then, no! Minus 19, when there's plus seven it makes minus 12.
00:10:26	S	Uhum!
00:10:27	T	It's correct. You've badly written the things, but your calculation is correct.
00:10:30	S	Yeah.
00:10:31	T	Two X is equal to minus 12. Now you want that only- that only X, therefore you-
00:10:35	S	Times a half.
00:10:35	T	Times a half. You find X equals minus six.
00:10:38	S	Yeah, I did it correctly.
00:10:39	T	It's correct.
00:10:42	T	So there, the same thing. You decide, you have X's only on the left. What's bothering you?
00:10:47	S	The five?
00:10:48	T	The five. Therefore?
00:10:50	S	I do plus minus five.
00:10:53	T	You do minus five. You write wrong things down, but you do the calculations correctly. You do minus five, therefore. You will find the four X here, and you
00:10:59	T	find 20 minus five, it equals, well?
00:11:01	S	Fifteen.
00:11:02	T	Fifteen. And then you must divide by- no, you must divide-there's not 15 which must- you must simply divide by?
00:11:04	S	Seven?
00:11:09	S	Twenty?
00:11:09	T	By?
00:11:10	S	By a quarter.
00:11:11	T	By quarter, therefore we need a quarter. You must find 15 quarters as a solution.
00:11:14	S	Sir?
00:11:15	T	Yes!
00:11:16	S	The thing (inaudible) must it always be on the left?
00:11:19	T	Not necessarily, you can also put it on the right.
00:11:21	S	Always X on the left?
00:11:24	T	Listen, generally people try and have it on the left because we've gotten used to saying X equals. But we'll see, maybe later,
00:11:30	T	er, there are some, later on here, where it's nicer to have it on the right because it's positive. Therefore we can directly find what X equals. Because sometimes we
00:11:38	T	will have minus one X, so we must multiply again by minus one.
00:11:41	S	Sir?
00:11:42	T	The purists always want X on the left. But is it really good? Yes!
00:11:49	S	It's always the same thing, 949?
00:11:53	T	Yeah, it's always the same thing but you can't do two things at the same time. You can't do- so sometimes you can't
00:11:57	T	do times a third then minus 12. To begin with, you must isolate- to start with- no- that one, you're not allowed to do it. The times a third.
00:12:00	T	To start with, you do minus 12. So what will you be staying with?
00:12:02	S	We inverse.
00:12:08	S	Bah! Three X.
00:12:10	T	Three X.
00:12:11	S	(inaudible) 48.
00:12:12	T	Three X, three X equals?
00:12:13	S	Forty-eight?
00:12:14	T	No...
00:12:14	S	No, er, 36.
00:12:15	T	If you do minus 12-
00:12:16	T	Thirty-six. Ah bother, I shouldn't have taken away the 36, it was there. So equals to 36. And then you can do times?
00:12:24	S	A third.
00:12:24	T	There now, is what I was saying before. We can't do several additions at the same- together. So we're going to do additions and multiplications together.
00:12:30	S	Ah! Yeah, okay.
00:12:31	T	Hum, hum?
00:12:32	S	Yeah, yeah, it's okay.
00:12:32	T	It's okay.
00:12:33	S	Thank you.
00:12:33	T	You're welcome.
00:12:35	S	Sir?
00:12:36	T	Yes!
00:12:37	S	There's a problem with C.
00:12:39	T	What's the problem with C.
00:12:40	S	I can't- I can't do it, C.
00:12:41	T	Take away five.
00:12:42	S	Yeah.
00:12:43	T	Okay. So what happens when you take away five?
00:12:46	S	Oh well, there also it goes away.
00:12:48	T	Well yeah. So write the thing again. The four X stays.
00:12:50	S	Yeah.
00:12:51	T	Equals? Fifteen. Then now. When four objects are worth 15 francs, what do you do to know the price of an object?
00:13:00	S	Well, I divide by, er, four?
00:13:03	T	Yeah, take a quarter.
00:13:04	S	Ah! Yeah.
00:13:06	T	It needs a quarter, and what happens?
00:13:09	S	(inaudible)
00:13:11	T	X equals fifteen over four.
00:13:13	S	Yeah.
00:13:14	T	The fraction is in numbers.
00:13:18	S	How?
00:13:19	T	No, X equals? You can't put the fraction between- under the fraction- under- the bar of fraction under the equality. X equals 15 over four.
00:13:29	S	(inaudible)
00:13:30	T	Yeah, if you like.
00:13:34	T	Yes.
00:13:36	SN	There, if we divide by four, the plus five must also be divided by four?
00:13:39	T	Oh well, yeah. Therefore we don't divide by four?
00:13:42	S	No.
00:13:42	T	No?
00:13:43	S	If we take away the five, afterwards we have four X is equal to 15.
00:13:45	T	And then.
00:13:46	S	And then we can.
00:13:47	T	Then it's not divided by four fifteen?
00:13:49	S	Yes, but it does have decimal points.
00:13:51	T	Ho, poor little one, if it does have decimal points, are they so painful, decimal points?
00:13:54	S	No.
00:13:54	T	Ha, good.
00:13:55	SN	But, Sir, (inaudible)?
00:13:58	T	So we leave the fraction, we will leave 15 quarters. Exactly.
00:14:01	SS	(inaudible)
00:14:03	S	(inaudible) seventy-five (inaudible) the fraction?
00:14:05	T	But it's 15 quarters. You've divided 15 by four, that's 15 quarters.
00:14:09	SN	Er, (inaudible).
00:14:12	T	Here you do minus 12, but when you did minus 12 here you touched only that 12 there. The three X you left alone.
00:14:18	S	(inaudible)
00:14:19	T	Leave it as three X. It stays three X here... And now you must still do a stage. So that's annoying because you...
00:14:20	S	(inaudible) do three.
00:14:26	T	You have already done the next one but... we do times one third, then we will find?
00:14:29	S	Third.
00:14:31	S	Uh...
00:14:32	T	X is equal to?
00:14:34	S	Twelve.
00:14:34	T	Twelve.
00:14:36	S	Humm.
00:14:37	T	Humm. But what do you do here?
00:14:40	S	Er, plus seven.
00:14:41	T	Plus seven.
00:14:44	T	What are you going to find?
00:14:46	S	Er, 12 X is equal to seven.
00:14:47	T	Well no... Minus 19 plus seven? Minus?
00:14:52	S	Well, uh...
00:14:56	T	Minus 19 plus seven?
00:14:58	S	Yeah, we must add that... yeah, well 26.
00:15:03	T	Tss-Tss.
00:15:03	S	Er, 25.
00:15:04	T	Tss-Tss.
00:15:06	T	Minus 19 plus seven?
00:15:10	T	You've got 19 objects missing, someone gives you back seven, how many do you have missing?
00:15:14	S	Well, er, 12.
00:15:17	T	So.
00:15:19	T	Then after that, what do we do?
00:15:21	S	Times one.
00:15:26	T	You want to take away the two?
00:15:27	S	Yeah, well times a second.
00:15:29	T	A half.
00:15:29	S	Yeah, a half.
00:15:30	T	Which will give, we take away the X. X equals.
00:15:33	S	Equals, is equal to...
00:15:37	T	Mental calculation.
00:15:38	S	Yes I know.
00:15:39	T	Twelve divided by two... the minus, it stays.
00:15:41	S	Minus six.
00:15:42	T	There now.
00:15:43	S	(inaudible)
00:15:45	T	Therefore here you must still put X is equal to 12 and here you must put X is equal to minus six.
00:15:49	S	Minus six. (inaudible) Thank you.
00:15:52	SS	Sir, Sir!
00:15:58	T	What is it?
00:16:00	SN	How do we go about for the two? Because I can do it, but in two stages.
00:16:03	T	Well yeah, and what? We never said one should do only one stage.
00:16:07	SN	(inaudible) a half?
00:16:09	T	Well yeah... But yeah, one can maybe do 10 stages if it's necessary. We never said one should do it in only one stage. One mustn't be
00:16:17	T	a minimalist, either.
00:16:21	SN	When we put there, er, we always first try to take away the part, er, on the right?
00:16:30	T	Yeah exactly. We try to take away the literal part on the right, if we decide to put it on the left. But, er, for F, for example, it can
00:16:37	T	be interesting, or for E, to put it on the right for example. To avoid the minuses, but one can do it in both cases.
00:16:41	SN	Sir!
00:16:42	T	Yes.
00:16:43	S	There now I've found for half of X, I will multiply by two to find X.
00:16:47	T	Why? I'm not okay with what you've done there. You've done a multiplication and a subtraction at the same time.
00:16:53	S	Well, you said it was (inaudible).
00:16:54	T	No, don't do it at the same time. One stage after the other. Excuse me, Gregoire... I think that, let's stop for awhile,
00:17:01	T	please. We look at A, we did it together as an example. Do you remember? And B also? It astonishes me,
00:17:12	T	though, because a lot of you did it wrong.
00:17:16	T	So we'll maybe just do B again together. Two X minus seven is equal to 19. So it's clear that you have two worries.
00:17:29	T	Here. You have one X which is multiplied by two. You want X on it's own.
00:17:33	SN	That's the least difficult.
00:17:40	T	Thank you.
00:17:43	T	Here you've got to realize something. You can't do everything at the same time. You mustn't think we have a problem, we put a
00:17:51	T	bar, then we have the solution underneath. We can maybe do one, two, three, four stages if it's needed... There's the stages also of literal
00:17:59	T	calculations. You'll see that when we calculate the data and there's brackets or something else, there will be some stages where we'll simply have
00:18:03	T	to work with the left part and the right part separately. Here, first thing, isolate everything unknown on the same side.
00:18:14	T	Therefore, what's bothering you here?
00:18:17	SN	Minus seven.
00:18:18	T	It's the minus seven. Therefore we do one stage with the minus seven... We make it plus seven.
00:18:24	T	And then we find two X is equal to?
00:18:27	SN	Minus 12.
00:18:28	T	Minus 12. And now we do one stage where we do times a-
00:18:32	SS	Half.
00:18:32	T	Half... Okay, and then we find one X is equal to minus six so the solution is minus six... If we take C... You have it nearly
00:18:42	T	exactly C, you've all done it. Four X plus five is equal to 20. So it's very well, er... Herve, to say I divide by four,
00:18:54	T	and at the same time I do minus five... It's what you did, it's that one?
00:19:00	SN	Yeah, at D.
00:19:01	T	Ah no, you did that in the next one, D. But look already here. It's the same thing here. We first try to isolate the X. There's only one place in X.
00:19:10	T	It's on the left, so what's bothering us?
00:19:12	SS	The minus five.
00:19:13	T	The minus five... Therefore I find four X is equal to 15. And then even if there are decimal points it doesn't matter. Now I do times a quarter.
00:19:24	T	And I find X is equal to 15 quarters. And what does it mean that it's 15 quarters? There are those who would prefer to put three, decimal point, seventy-five.
00:19:31	T	I remind you it's better as a fraction, because if by any chance it wasn't a fraction which gives a rational number which
00:19:39	T	finishes itself, it's not interesting... Okay? A number with decimal points which finish. If we have periodical numbers it's never very interesting, we
00:19:46	T	can't use them on the calculator. On the other hand, 15 quarters we can put in... Therefore S is equal to 15 quarters. So that's true.
00:19:55	T	When one looks at D for example, where one has four X, it's what in D? Four X plus five again.
00:20:02	SS	(inaudible)
00:20:05	T	Two X minus 16?
00:20:06	SS	Thirteen.
00:20:06	SS	Thirteen. Thank you. When we have this, it's true one would want to say: I've got multiples of X on both sides. Valentine?
00:20:14	SN	So we put the bar and we do minus, er, minus two X.
00:20:18	SN	Times a half.
00:20:19	T	So why do times a half?
00:20:21	S	To do a (inaudible).
00:20:22	T	So I tell you honestly, it's not good to do times a half. We're going to write what Herve said, then we're going to look at how we can
00:20:27	T	complicate a problem which wasn't too complicated to start with.
00:20:30	SN	We can (inaudible).
00:20:31	T	How to complicate it when one can do it simply... that's Herve's proposition. Look, I do times a half, I am-
00:20:38	T	Okay, when doing times a half, let's look at what happens. I'll change colors on purpose for you to realize that it's not
00:20:42	T	the ideal. If I do times a half, how many X's do I have here?
00:20:45	SS	Two.
00:20:45	T	Two X.
00:20:46	SN	No, half of X.
00:20:47	T	No.
00:20:48	S	No. I've got an idea. Times half X.
00:20:50	T	You can't do times half X... You can't do times letters... It's forbidden, we've seen. Do you want me to show you again on the
00:20:58	T	transparency what happens? Do you remember? Suddenly it has curves. We have raised one solution. Therefore we only have three possibilities
00:21:05	T	to do something... All numbers, add letters, or multiply by a number which is not equal to zero... We can't
00:21:13	T	multiply by a literal part... We're not allowed to do that. Therefore when you say to me a half of X, but do times a half. It
00:21:21	T	doesn't bother me in that case there, the only difference is in my point of view, I absolutely haven't gained anything... because first of all I still have X's on
00:21:29	T	both sides... And what's more I've gained fractions. And since we all like working with fractions, we want to have them in
00:21:37	T	the solution, the fractions. We're okay? Gregoire, we want to have them in the solution? It's correct or not? But to have them now it's
00:21:45	T	not comfortable... After, you don't know anymore how to add fractions and then you get into trouble. Why get into trouble?
00:21:54	T	All right? On one's sheet of paper when one had something one could do easily. So do we continue doing times a half here-
00:21:59	T	Herve? Do you insist?
00:22:01	SN	No.
00:22:02	T	No. Thank you.
00:22:04	T	So let's try to start like before, using times. To use times we need more polynomials. That one only has monomials on
00:22:14	T	the left or the right. Okay? We isolate. Therefore for the first we shall say what?
00:22:19	SN	We can do (inaudible)?
00:22:25	T	So it's correct, it's correct, Camille. We can do minus two X. One can also do minus five. Because at the moment we say we'll do
00:22:34	T	minus two X, we've decided the X's will be on the left.
00:22:36	SN	Nine.
00:22:38	T	We can do both at the same time.
00:22:39	SN	We can put them one after the other.
00:22:40	T	So there one can put them one after the other because it's two additions.
00:22:42	SN	All right.
00:22:43	SN	Are we obliged to do them both at the same time?
00:22:44	T	No, you can do them separately. After there's a problem of production, of efficiency, when you do exercises and one tells you I would like you to
00:22:51	T	do 15 in 45 minutes, er, if you have two stages you will lose a little time. But that's training.
00:22:59	SN	(inaudible)
00:23:01	T	It's better to get the correct answer than to finish quickly with all the results wrong, you're right... So here we get to two X is equal to...
00:23:10	T	because minus two X minus five.
00:23:12	SN	Minus one.
00:23:13	T	Minus?
00:23:14	SN	Minus (inaudible).
00:23:15	SN	No, minus 13.
00:23:17	SN	Minus 18.
00:23:17	SN	But how much is it when one does minus 13 minus five?
00:23:19	SN	Minus 18.
00:23:20	T	Well, minus 13 minus five, you've got 13 objects missing, someone asks you for five more, you've got 18 missing.
00:23:24	SN	Ha, yeah.
00:23:25	SN	(inaudible) divided by two.
00:23:26	T	It seems to me, I don't know... And then after?
00:23:29	S	Divided by a half.
00:23:31	T	No.
00:23:31	S	Not divided, times a half, yeah.
00:23:33	T	There now, either we do times a half or we divide by two, but we can't... times a half. X is equal to?
00:23:40	SN	Minus nine.
00:23:41	T	Minus nine... Okay. The S is equal to minus nine.
00:23:49	T	Is there a question on this? Can we continue now? Let's advance.
00:23:56	T	Yes?
00:23:58	SN	Er, there how do we do it?
00:24:00	T	So everywhere there are brackets, to start with we take away the brackets.
00:24:03	S	(inaudible)
00:24:06	T	No.
00:24:06	S	It's wrong?
00:24:07	T	It's wrong.
00:24:09	S	Ha, yeah, nine is wrong.
00:24:13	T	That is wrong.
00:24:17	T	The X cube is wrong. Ha, it was three X actually.
00:24:19	S	Yeah.
00:24:20	T	Ha, yeah.
00:24:22	S	It makes- it makes seven.
00:24:24	T	Me, I would like it better when you have something like that. So there do as Ludivine said. You write again the object when you've taken away the brackets.
00:24:32	S	Yeah, okay.
00:24:33	T	You do here the thing like this, you can say I'm doing literal calculation.
00:24:37	S	Yeah.
00:24:39	T	And then I find four X minus five is equal to six... 27... Then now I can work as I did before...
00:24:43	S	Six X over 27,
00:24:48	S	but now if we do minus six X to pass it on this side (inaudible) to minus two.
00:24:51	T	It's not interesting. We have minus, yeah.
00:24:54	S	Well, then we do minus four X and we pass (inaudible).
00:24:55	T	There then, so we decide to have the X's on the right. It doesn't matter.
00:25:00	S	Ah yeah, but-
00:25:00	T	If X is equal to three or three is equal to X? What changes for you?
00:25:03	S	Nothing.
00:25:05	T	Okay. So it's what I told you. There are purists who absolutely want to have the X on the left. But finally as far as efficiency,
00:25:11	T	in what we'll want to do later on to find problems, resolve problems, it doesn't take us very far.
00:25:21	S	And after we do it like that.
00:25:23	T	No you can't... After what must you do?
00:25:28	S	On that.
00:25:30	T	Minus 27. Okay. And what will we get?
00:25:33	S	Well it's minus... 32.
00:25:35	T	Minus 32 is equal to?
00:25:38	S	(inaudible)
00:25:39	T	Therefore-
00:25:41	S	Times a half.
00:25:42	T	Times a half. And you find X?
00:25:45	S	(inaudible)
00:25:46	T	Yeah, 32 over two. Thirty-two over two.
00:25:51	S	Therefore there it makes minus 16.
00:25:52	T	Minus 16 is equal to X.
00:25:55	S	Ha, yeah.
00:25:56	T	S equals minus five. Anyway, one writes S equals, so whether one has X equals minus 16 or minus 16 equals X.
00:26:03	S	Yeah, it doesn't matter.
00:26:04	T	The element on the left is equal to the one on the right. Whether X is on the left or the right. All right?
00:26:09	S	Yeah.
00:26:10	T	Okay?
00:26:10	SN	Sir? Sir?
00:26:11	S	One can't have zero X.
00:26:14	T	No, it would be better not to have zero X, because then we're not well.
00:26:16	S	But because there it gives us zero X if we do minus 17 X.
00:26:20	T	Well, yeah.
00:26:20	S	It takes away each time, er.
00:26:21	T	Therefore you're going to find how much? Zero, yeah that's right. Well yeah, it's going to start to get interesting. Wait, let's look if you've already taken-
00:26:23	S	Ha yeah, it makes (inaudible).
00:26:27	T	the correct data. That one, yeah, that's going to become interesting. What do you find? You do minus 17 X.
00:26:33	S	I do minus 17 only.
00:26:34	T	No you must do minus 17 X, okay. You take away this 17 X to put it here. You've had the idea to do it like this. You do minus 17 X.
00:26:39	T	Therefore you find two here.
00:26:41	S	Yeah.
00:26:42	T	So write two. Two equals minus two... So now.
00:26:47	S	(inaudible)
00:26:49	T	You can't do.
00:26:50	SN	But it's wrong, but it's not possible.
00:26:52	SN	(inaudible)
00:26:53	T	So it's not wrong, it's that this equation doesn't have a solution.
00:26:57	S	Wah! (inaudible).
00:26:58	T	Is there some X which will permit you to say: whatever X you chose, you will have two equals minus two? There's something which
00:27:04	T	doesn't work, therefore you're going to say X equals the whole?
00:27:06	S	Empty.
00:27:07	T	To the empty set, right?
00:27:09	S	(inaudible)
00:27:10	T	Yes, but that is the set containing the empty set, therefore it's no longer empty.
00:27:14	S	Ha ha, what does that mean?
00:27:16	SN	It means (inaudible).
00:27:16	T	That's all. The word there, that symbol means empty set.
00:27:21	SN	So when there's... when there's, when it's impossible I must put only that?
00:27:23	SN	Sir!
00:27:24	SN	Sir!
00:27:25	SN	Sir!
00:27:25	T	That's right, yeah.
00:27:27	SN	E I understand very well.
00:27:29	T	No, why do you do minus five X? Is there anywhere here where there's a minus five X?
00:27:35	SN	Well no, but to have X alone.
00:27:37	T	We didn't say one must have X alone there. We must first take away that X there. Is it X which is bothering you?
00:27:42	S	Yeah.
00:27:43	T	I'm coming, I'm here. If I take this X, what do I do to take away this X? I don't do minus five X?
00:27:49	S	I do minus X.
00:27:50	T	You do minus X. So now do only minus X.
00:27:52	E	(inaudible)
00:27:54	T	Yes?
00:27:55	SN	Is it possible that equations don't work like that one?
00:27:59	T	Where are you there?
00:28:00	S	At (inaudible). It's not possible? If four X is equal to four X.
00:28:05	T	No, it's not possible.
00:28:06	S	So what do we put?
00:28:08	T	Well, look at what happens. Do something.
00:28:11	S	Well, yeah, but-
00:28:11	T	You must do minus four X.
00:28:12	S	Yeah.
00:28:13	T	So do minus four X, then look at what happens. I'll come back.
00:28:15	SN	Sir!
00:28:16	T	Yes.
00:28:17	S	Er, here what do we do?
00:28:20	T	For E... Well minus four X plus 15, well what. You do minus 15.
00:28:26	S	Yeah (inaudible).
00:28:27	T	I did minus four X... Your 15 falls, then minus 15 plus two... That doesn't bother me. Eleven minus 15?
00:28:35	S	And for E? Is it correct here, if I put this?
00:28:39	SN	(inaudible) the minus four, the over four it's also here?
00:28:41	T	But why do you divide by four when you have an addition? You mustn't do that when you have an addition, because
00:28:48	T	otherwise each element of the addition will divide up. There you're again in the case we just showed before, with the case that
00:28:54	T	Herve said where I divide first, then after, you have 15 quarters with 11 quarters.
00:28:59	S	Well, we must do minus 15.
00:29:00	T	For the first one you do minus 15. At the first isolate the X or multiply them by X.
00:29:06	SN	There, four X, er, four X.
00:29:08	T	Well you take away four X.
00:29:10	S	But (inaudible).
00:29:10	T	Zero equals, no you find zero equals minus one. Possible, not possible?
00:29:15	SN	Impossible.
00:29:16	T	Impossible. S equals?
00:29:18	S	Well, Q something.
00:29:19	T	(inaudible)
00:29:28	T	The slash in the middle.
00:29:29	SN	Sir?
00:29:29	SN	Sir! After, can one do times 15?
00:29:31	T	So after, when you have the four X alone, you can do times a quarter.
00:29:35	S	Aah!
00:29:36	SN	Sir?
00:29:37	T	Yes.
00:29:37	S	But no, Sir!
00:29:38	T	I'm coming, I'm coming.
00:29:40	S	Is it possible that (inaudible)?
00:29:45	T	No. No, because if you do plus five X, you've got X here but five X here also.
00:29:50	S	Ha, yeah.
00:29:51	SN	Sir! Is it right, that one? That one also.
00:29:57	T	Yes. That one's okay- and then that one... why is it- what's this six X? Where does it come from, this six X? Well, what I don't understand you've (inaudible) got a
00:30:05	T	solution in X there. You haven't eliminated your X's? You haven't eliminated your X's!
00:30:09	S	But no, but- if I eliminate that one, after that one has minus something-
00:30:13	T	But it doesn't matter... It's impossible to have minus. After, we'll do minus something.
00:30:21	SN	Is this correct?
00:30:25	T	No.
00:30:26	S	Why?
00:30:26	T	No. If you take away three X here... So look at one thing. We'll look at this all together, please,
00:30:34	S	Ah! No, no, no.
00:30:38	T	Please, we'll look at this all together.
00:30:40	E	(inaudible)
00:30:43	T	Shh! Er, Camille get back to your seat please- we'll look at- I would just like to show you something- because there's- there's
00:30:50	T	the idea- it's- we- we will listen to- to what Valentine says, and then we'll try to see what- what doesn't match in her story. So
00:30:59	T	for the one, there's minus four X plus 15 is equal to 11. So Valentine said: I would like to have X on the left. We're okay, I'm going to have X on
00:31:08	T	the left, all right? So she says to herself but I want X. Therefore you go from minus four X to X, I do plus five X, right or wrong?
00:31:16	S	Yes.
00:31:17	T	Yeah, so she says to herself, I'm going to do plus five X, then at the same time you do minus 15, all right?
00:31:20	SN	Yeah.
00:31:21	T	So then, I write this.
00:31:25	S	(inaudible) copycat.
00:31:26	T	Who said that, copycat?
00:31:28	S	Me!
00:31:29	T	You. You also want to do that.
00:31:30	S	Well, yeah.
00:31:31	T	Yeah, so, If I do plus five X. I remind you that everything I do here will be on both the left and the right side of the equality. Therefore if I
00:31:41	T	do plus five X, yes Miss, you'll have X here, the 15 will fall, wonderful, equal? But only on the right, the five X, it will
00:31:53	T	reappear. And then you'll have five X plus?
00:31:58	SS	Minus four.
00:31:59	T	Minus four, it's all you've gained Miss. Now you have everything- X's. Before you had an advantage,
00:32:05	T	Valentine, you had an advantage, that here you had X's only on one side. Now, you've won so much that you've got X's on both sides...
00:32:14	T	So one shouldn't want to add something to raise (inaudible). One must say to oneself: do I have X's on both sides or not. That's not
00:32:23	T	at all okay, because now you've won nothing. I remind you everything you do, I repeat, I repeat once more, everything you
00:32:29	T	do here will apply itself on both sides of the equality. Therefore if you do plus five, because you only look at that because you've only
00:32:38	T	looked- you've got an idea- you've put blinders there, all right? You know those blinders, one puts on horses, all right? So if you've
00:32:46	T	put blinkers and then you only look at part of your equation; stand back and look at all of the equation. The equation here, when I
00:32:54	T	look at it entirely, as it is- I will erase the one above so we see it well, all right! I've even erased the 15 with that. When
00:33:03	T	you look at this, what happens? You say to yourself ah, yeah, great! You're happy. Why? You've got on only one side with
00:33:12	T	X's. They don't create a problem, they are already on the left. So I leave them on the left. I don't bother about the X's for the time being. What
00:33:21	T	is bothering me here? In a global way, what's bothering me?
00:33:25	SS	The 15.
00:33:26	T	It's the 15, it's all. There's only the 15, which is bothering me to isolate the X's. So I do only the minus 15 and I find minus
00:33:33	T	four X is equal to?
00:33:36	SS	Minus four.
00:33:37	T	Minus four.
00:33:38	SN	Then we do times, times a quarter.
00:33:39	T	Haha.
00:33:41	SN	Minus a quarter.
00:33:41	T	Times minus a quarter.
00:33:42	T	Times, so a quarter to take the four away, okay? But what's bothering me also?
00:33:48	SN	It's the minus.
00:33:48	T	It's the minus. That one there doesn't bother me.
00:33:52	S	Times minus a quarter.
00:33:53	T	Times minus a quarter. The minus to take away the minus... And then the quarter to take away the four. Then after I have X, then I apply this minus-
00:34:03	T	A quarter times minus a quarter equals minus four. Therefore I find X equals?
00:34:08	SS	One.
00:34:08	T	One... okay? One must be careful with this. One must work only with the elements you have in the equation. You mustn't start
00:34:17	T	looking for others which please you. There are already enough in here, you must not look for others.
00:34:26	SN	(inaudible) 250.
00:34:28	T	To do calculations, you must take away the brackets.
00:34:30	S	And is that all?
00:34:31	T	Then after you do the same problem.
00:34:33	SN	Sir?
00:34:38	T	Yes!
00:34:39	S	Can you come and see?
00:34:40	T	So we will start there, I go round like this.
00:34:42	SN	Er, here there we do times 10, that like, after we have no more commas here?
00:34:46	T	Well yeah, and you've found X equals zero two. Exactly.
00:34:51	SN	(inaudible) is it correct?
00:34:54	T	I don't know if it's correct but-
00:34:56	SN	We do plus (inaudible).
00:34:57	T	If you do minus two X here. If you take away two X and then you've got two.
00:35:02	SN	Yeah, but there aren't anymore at all.
00:35:04	T	You've got two pencils. Minus two pencils, how many have you got?
00:35:07	S	No more.
00:35:08	T	So.
00:35:09	S	It does... minus seven X.
00:35:12	T	Equals?
00:35:13	S	Twenty-one.
00:35:14	T	Twenty-one... Then now how are you going to take away this minus X? Now it's good. Now you have a multiple of X alone. So
00:35:23	T	what do you do? You're not going to add this 21 on the same side?
00:35:28	S	After, well, we do divided by seven X.
00:35:32	T	No, not seven X, we want to keep the X.
00:35:34	S	Times (inaudible) a seventh.
00:35:36	T	Times minus to take away this minus, then a seventh to take away this seven.
00:35:41	S	Ha, yeah.
00:35:44	T	Okay?
00:35:44	S	Hmm.
00:35:45	T	And then it will give us what? So here we're going to be able, we'll rub out already (inaudible) with the eraser.
00:35:50	SN	Why is it minus two X at the top?
00:35:53	T	But because look at these two X, they are bothering us. These two X there, that's the one we want to take away.
00:35:57	S	Why isn't it the minus seven X?
00:35:58	T	Well because otherwise we must put the 21 on the other side, it's the same thing. As we see that there's only X's already here, we will
00:36:04	T	try and put everything this side... we choose a side where we want to put the X's.
00:36:08	SN	Hmm.
00:36:10	T	We can put it the other way round if you wish.
00:36:12	SN	But after that, this thing we must also do it at 21?
00:36:15	T	Ha, well of course. I said everything we do behind this vertical bar here, we must do it on both sides.
00:36:23	S	Why does it stay (inaudible), why (inaudible)?
00:36:24	T	So it makes X, but 21 divided by seven.
00:36:28	S	Er, three.
00:36:29	T	Three. Then there was a little minus, therefore it makes minus three. You can rub out what you had here.
00:36:33	S	Ha, therefore X becomes minus three.
00:36:34	T	But yeah, simply.
00:36:36	S	And then that one?
00:36:39	T	Ha. That one is more problematic. You mustn't divide by four.
00:36:42	SN	But, Sir.
00:36:42	T	Yes.
00:36:43	SN	(inaudible) the minus seven X there?
00:36:45	T	Well, because I did minus two X.
00:36:47	S	Minus five X or minus two X.
00:36:48	T	I- yes. I must still go over there behind.
00:36:51	SN	The solution must be the solution which is the least, it must be more.
00:36:54	T	Must be X... Yeah. Yeah. That's why we do as you're doing here. You can do times minus one, but you could very well have done
00:37:00	T	directly minus one. You do times minus one... Then 42.
00:37:04	T	Quarter, you can put twenty-one and a half.
00:37:06	S	Yeah.
00:37:08	T	There was a question here on this side. Who was it? Ha, yeah, Aurore.
00:37:13	SN	Er, here (inaudible) we do there we would put minus 21, that doesn't do anything above?
00:37:17	T	No, it would be minus five X minus 21.
00:37:19	S	(inaudible) minus three.
00:37:22	T	Well, yeah.
00:37:23	S	So it still does something?
00:37:25	T	Well, yeah, it does something.
00:37:27	S	(inaudible)?
00:37:29	T	No... Why do you want minus 21?
00:37:30	SN	Sir. Is this correct?
00:37:33	SN	I had. I had.
00:37:34	T	No you've done times, times a seventh, minus a seventh, so the 21 is affected by the times minus a seventh.
00:37:38	S	Is it correct?
00:37:39	T	Yeah. So I'll do F. I'll put F up. Yes, Herve?
00:37:44	SN	(inaudible)
00:37:45	T	Well, precisely, I'll do it. It's wrong there. So I'll come- I'll do F, then after we'll look at G together, because G has something tricky.
00:37:53	T	We'll quickly look at F. So F, it's five X, er, minus five X is equal to two X plus 21. Is that correct?
00:38:01	SS	Yeah.
00:38:02	T	Okay, so again here, I've already got on the left only X's... Therefore I'll pass- I'll eliminate the X's on the right. How do I eliminate the X's?
00:38:14	SS	Minus two X.
00:38:15	T	I do minus two X. What does it give me? It gives me minus seven X is equal to 21. What's bothering me now?
00:38:23	SN	The minus seven.
00:38:23	T	It's the minus seven, it is being multiplied... It is being multiplied. Therefore times minus one.
00:38:31	SS	A seventh.
00:38:32	T	A seventh... Which gives us X equals?
00:38:35	SN	Minus three.
00:38:36	T	Minus three, simply. So now it's true on the other hand for that part... So there's S equals minus three.
00:38:49	T	It's true for the G part.
00:38:57	T	The G part, what do we have that's tricky? We have four X is equal to four X... minus one. So how are we going to see that?
00:39:04	SS	It's not possible!
00:39:09	T	It's impossible. Valentine?
00:39:11	SN	Because it would need a place, for example four X is equal to three X minus one. Otherwise we can't take away the X's. We can't take away one.
00:39:21	T	Let's try to take it away, let's try to be as methodical as we can, then let's see what happens. Let's see, where do we find, so-
00:39:28	SN	Times four X.
00:39:30	T	You're okay that this four X is bothering you.
00:39:32	SS	Yeah.
00:39:33	SN	We do minus four X.
00:39:34	T	So we do minus four X.
00:39:35	S	So it does zero equals zero.
00:39:35	T	We find zero X. Therefore zero is equal to minus one. Is that possible?
00:39:42	SS	No!
00:39:43	T	No. Therefore when you get to a case like this...
00:39:46	B	[Blackboard: Empty set sign.]
00:39:47	T	What does this mean graphically? Four X equals four X minus one. If we did it again graphically as we did it here.
00:39:54	SN	It's parallel.
00:39:56	T	Yes Sir Jean-Pierre! It's parallel. Do you remember that? If I do the axis of the X's here, the axis of the function G of X and D of X, the
00:40:06	T	function on the left and the function on the right... four X it's what? (inaudible) the origin of four X, I start from where? Four X, the force- the- the-
00:40:16	T	the equation which says: G of R of R, X goes on four X.
00:40:24	SS	It starts from zero.
00:40:27	T	It starts from zero. Right. We'll put it in one color. That one there. Here, it starts from zero and each time it advances it goes up how much?
00:40:35	SS	Four.
00:40:36	T	Up four. Okay... it goes up like this.
00:40:45	T	And then it goes down also each time. Each time I go backwards, I go down four. Are we okay?
00:40:49	SS	Yeah.
00:40:49	T	That's okay? That's the function of G, the left element. The right element... what nice little colors here would
00:40:59	T	distinguish this from blue? We don't have much... a little orange, a green. We'll see the difference but I don't have anymore orange... So the
00:41:12	T	function of the right side. I'll write it here... it says- it says from R to R, X goes on four X minus one. Therefore it means I go from where?
00:41:25	SS	Minus one.
00:41:25	T	I go from minus one on- there and then, each time I advance one, I go up four.
00:41:31	S	Well it would do a (inaudible).
00:41:33	S	It is parallel.
00:41:33	T	It is, well, parallel. Therefore when do they meet each other, these two parallel lines?
00:41:37	SS	Never.
00:41:37	T	Never. Therefore the- what we're looking for as a solution, it's the points that meet each other. Therefore there's none. Therefore one can say it's
00:41:45	T	it's- Do you visualize geometrically what's happening? Okay? Therefore that case, it's S equals- parallel. Okay?
00:41:54	T	Okay? That's the function of the right side.
00:41:58	S	Sir.
00:42:00	T	Yes.
00:42:01	S	Can I go to the bathroom?
00:42:03	T	You can wait two minutes. The bell will ring in two minutes. Yeah?
00:42:09	SN	The first, I didn't understand why (inaudible).
00:42:13	T	What's bothering you? Well then, how do we take away a fraction?
00:42:16	S	Well, we (inaudible) another fraction.
00:42:18	T	Well yeah, which one? To take away the five, you did what? If you had only five X, what would you do?
00:42:23	S	Well, er, times a fifth.
00:42:25	T	A fifth. If you had only the- you would do times? Times two.
00:42:33	S	(inaudible)
00:42:34	T	No, times two. Times two, therefore times two fifths. Oh, I've put green, that's my print.
00:42:57	T	So I'll let you continue now, on this 948 and we'll correct next time the- the- the other ones, all right? We are
00:43:05	T	obliged. We'll correct H, I, K. Yeah.
00:43:10	SN	Sir, (inaudible).
00:43:12	T	Hum um...(inaudible) we do.
00:43:17	S	Is it correct?
00:43:44	T	I've got 949.
00:44:06	S	Sir?
00:44:07	T	Yes.
00:44:08	S	Come and see.
00:44:09	T	Of course.
00:44:13	S	(inaudible) minus, er, minus, the X either negative or positive?
00:44:18	T	It had better be positive. It would avoid us- because every time there'll be minuses we'll make a mistake. What's bothering you?
00:44:24	S	Well there, it's to leave it like that.
00:44:25	T	No. Here you've got six X, here you've got five X- you've got X.
00:44:28	S	Yeah.
00:44:28	T	Well, which is the one bothering you? Where are there the most X's? On the left or on the right? So you stay on the left and then you take away.
00:44:35	S	Ah yeah, so, I do minus one.
00:44:36	T	Minus X, yeah, you do minus X.
00:44:48	S	Well, it does (inaudible)... and then after- to do- divide by, er.
00:44:51	T	Not before doing division. As long as you have a polynomial, you don't do division. It's a principle you've got to keep to.
00:44:59	T	Therefore now?
00:45:00	S	We do plus 10.
00:45:01	T	You do plus 10.
00:45:04	O	[Bell]
00:45:06	T	Okay then... Okay then, we'll see each other after the break.
