00:14:56	T	Brandon?
00:14:57	SN	What if you put on number, uh, where it says integers between negative five and negative eight.

00:15:22	T	Some of you drew lines which is okay. Yes, Marcus?
00:15:24	SN	Uh, I have a question. Well- well-
00:15:26	S	Okay, on the first it says like graph one through four. It's- you're supposed to graph it on the top one, right? Like on-
00:15:33	T	One through four?
00:15:34	S	Yeah, you're supposed to graph it on top, right?

00:15:47	S	Yeah, 'cause I... put it (inaudible).
00:15:50	T	Oh, that's fine too. Just so we know that it's one and four. It's pretty close to those numbers. Any other questions?
00:15:59	T	Okay, how about the bottom. What did it spell out? Michelle?
00:16:01	SN	Seattle.
00:16:02	T	Seattle. When we make a deposit into a bank account, does that mean we put money in or take it out? Jen?

00:18:05	S	Because it's equal part, so...
00:18:06	T	Okay. That's a good- we're not doing absolute value though. Are we?
00:18:11	T	We're just simply like- look at our number line up here John. Negative one or positive one. Which one is greater?
00:18:18	S	One.
00:18:19	T	Right. That's what they were asking for. Not how far each one was apart from zero.
00:18:23	S	Oh, okay.

00:20:00	T	Volunteer to read our quote of the week? Michelle?
00:20:05	SN	"What is the best- What is best in mathematics deserves not merely to be learned as a task,
00:20:11	S	but to be assimilated as a part of daily thought, and brought again and again before the mind with ever renewed encouragement".
00:20:22	T	Very good. What does that mean, anybody? Patrick?
00:20:25	SN	It means to not think of math as a like- as not something fun to do and only use it in school but to use it in your everyday life.
00:20:35	T	Very good. Anybody else? Brandon?
00:20:37	SN	That math is around you all the time.
00:20:39	T	That's correct. And it means don't just learn it as a- because you have to.
00:20:45	T	Learn it because you want to and have it as a part of your daily life because math is?
00:20:50	SS	Power.
00:20:51	T	All right. Good. Okay.
00:20:54	T	Today's lesson is titled, Writing Variable Expressions. So please title your notes.
00:21:19	T	Okay, I want you to think for a minute. I know- I know you can do this.
00:21:27	T	There are times throughout the day, I'm sure, where you hear words but in actuality you're talking about numbers.
00:21:37	T	For example, Suzie is six inches shorter than Mary. Anybody else think of an example that you hear? Ashley?
00:21:47	SN	How old is she turning?
00:21:49	T	Okay. Brandon?
00:21:51	SN	Tom is five inches taller than Suzie.
00:21:54	T	Okay. Anybody else? Patrick?
00:22:00	SN	Uh, never mind.
00:22:02	T	Kendra?
00:22:03	SN	Like, when you're taking a test or something and the teacher is like, you got a 20 out of like, 40.
00:22:07	T	Good. Good Kendra. Alex?
00:22:09	SN	Your pizza is two-fifty.
00:22:11	T	Okay. Is that how much they cost here?
00:22:13	SS	Yeah.
00:22:14	SN	Yep. They rip you off.
00:22:16	T	Tim?
00:22:17	SN	Like my shoe size is like 12 and (inaudible) are (inaudible).
00:22:20	T	Compared to maybe somebody else's?
00:22:22	S	Yeah.
00:22:23	T	Okay, good. Now, I want you to think of another example here.
00:22:28	T	Say you have an after school job. You make seven dollars an hour. But this week, you're busy, you can only work two hours.
00:22:39	T	But, next week you can work 10. So I'm going to put up here, seven dollars H.
00:22:48	T	What is H? Does anyone know? Alex?
00:22:52	SN	Hour.
00:22:53	T	It's the hours. Good.
00:22:56	T	What is H called? Does anyone know that? Patrick? Patrick?
00:23:02	SN	Me?
00:23:03	T	Yes.
00:23:04	S	Okay.
00:23:05	T	Patrick.
00:23:06	S	A variable?
00:23:07	T	Good. A variable. So writing expressions today, variable is number one.
00:23:13	T	It's a letter that represents a value that can change.
00:23:21	T	The example I gave you, that H can change. Two hours this week. Ten hours next week. Variable.
00:23:34	T	Yes Brandon?
00:23:35	SN	So the numbers change, not the, uh, letter?
00:23:39	T	Well what goes in for the letter changes?
00:23:41	S	Numbers?
00:23:43	T	Correct. Yes?
00:23:45	SN	Then like- so you have like eight dollars could you go like eight and like B?
00:23:49	T	Sure. Yes. You can use any letter. Any letter in the alphabet will work.
00:23:50	S	So, you can-
00:24:05	T	Okay, that's a variable. What I wrote on the board, seven H, is called a variable expression because it contains a variable.
00:24:17	T	You'll see it up there as one of the examples and the other two are also examples of variable expressions.
00:24:36	T	Can you see?
00:24:49	T	So we have variable and variable expression.
00:24:56	T	Say that job that I have represented up here. You get a raise. You now make seven-fifty an hour. How will that change? Jen?
00:25:09	SN	There'll be point fifty after seven?
00:25:11	T	Okay, so seven point five H, right?
00:25:15	S	Yeah.
00:25:16	T	Okay. Brandon?
00:25:17	SN	I don't- I didn't get it.
00:25:19	T	Which part?
00:25:20	S	The uh, the H, seven H and then the four- where do you get the four W's to-
00:25:25	T	That's just an example. That's just another example of a variable expression. Okay?
00:25:31	T	Okay. Another example. You're going to an Eagles game.
00:25:37	SS	Oh.
00:25:39	T	Tim? I used Phillies in my other classes but for you Tim, I used Eagles.
00:25:43	SN	First the Raiders.
00:25:44	T	Okay? You're going to an Eagles game. They're selling hot dogs. They're very good by the way in Philadelphia.
00:25:52	SN	So are the cheese steaks.
00:25:54	T	So are the cheese steaks, you're right.
00:25:54	T	Okay. But, the hot dogs at Vet stadium where the Eagles play sell for three dollars.
00:26:01	T	I want you to give me a variable expression for N hotdogs. Marcus?
00:26:12	SN	N, hot, over three dollars. Or-
00:26:16	T	Not over because that means divided.
00:26:18	S	Three N.
00:26:20	T	Three N. Three N means however many I buy I have to pay three dollars for, right?
00:26:25	SN	Where do you get the N from?
00:26:26	T	That's- I just said, that's the N number of hotdogs. That's what I'm using as my variable. Jen?
00:26:32	SN	Wouldn't that mean you have to multiply them?
00:26:34	T	Yes. That's right. So if I got two hotdogs how much money am I spending?
00:26:38	SS	Six dollars.
00:26:39	T	Three times two. Good, Jen. Yes?
00:26:42	SN	Can it be like any letter?
00:26:43	T	It can be any letter. Yes, Michelle it can be. Good question.
00:26:45	SN	But isn't it confusing?
00:26:47	T	It can be any letter, Brandon. Whatever you choose. Okay, part B today. Evaluating Expressions.
00:26:54	T	What I just did with the two dollars for a hotdog was evaluating an expression.
00:27:02	T	So if I come back to my original example on the board here, seven H, and I said you worked two hours this week,
00:27:13	T	How much money are you going to make this week, Ryan?
00:27:17	SN	Fourteen.
00:27:18	T	Fourteen. How much would you make if you worked ten hours next week? Josh?
00:27:23	SN	Seventy.
00:27:24	T	Good. What we just did was we took the number of hours and did what? Michelle?
00:27:32	SN	Multiplied it by a seven.
00:27:34	T	Good. But what- we actually put it in for there? Didn't we? Put it in for the H?
00:27:38	T	Well, that's what evaluating means. Substituting a number for a variable. Yes?
00:27:48	SN	So for the hotdog thing, would the N be two?
00:27:52	T	Yes. We substituted two for the N.
00:27:55	SN	Oh.
00:27:56	T	We evaluated that example.
00:27:59	SN	Do you have to write that then? Or, can you just write like how- like however many dollars it was times two?
00:28:06	T	Yeah. Do you have to write what- what? This?
00:28:09	S	Do you have to write the N or-
00:28:10	T	Well normally you'll be given that, yes.
00:28:12	S	Okay.
00:28:14	T	You won't be given- like if we're just talking, of course, I'm not going to say write down, but-
00:28:19	T	You'll be given expressions and asked to evaluate for a certain amount of money or numbers.
00:28:36	T	So I'm going to give you an example- Here's what you were asking me Jen. Evaluate the expression, four H plus three.
00:28:44	T	Now the part four H plus three is the expression and then it says for H equals two. What are we going to do with that?
00:28:52	T	What are we going to do with H equals two? Marcus?
00:28:58	SN	I guess like four times two. Four times two plus three, would be eleven.
00:29:03	T	Good.
00:29:06	T	Okay. What we- Marcus did here was, wherever he saw an H in our expression he substituted a two. So that was the first step.
00:29:18	T	And remember, if there is nothing in between a number and parenthesis what operation do we do?
00:29:26	SN	Multiplication.
00:29:27	T	Patrick?
00:29:28	SN	Multiplication.
00:29:29	T	Good. And as Marcus said then, the answer is eight because four- I mean 11- four times two is eight, we add three, and we get 11.
00:29:58	T	Any questions so far?
00:30:17	T	Okay. Now, I'm sure you often hear, probably on radio ads or- or maybe even here at school,
00:30:28	T	Phrases such as twice as much, three times as long, half as heavy. Yes?
00:30:37	SN	So my answer to the question is, four times two is eight, plus three is-
00:30:42	T	Is 11.
00:30:43	S	All right.
00:30:45	T	Okay? So you hear phrases like that. Twice as much. You hear that at the store, right? Or, things like that.
00:30:52	T	Three times as long. Social Studies class is three times as long as math.
00:30:59	SN	It is?
00:31:00	T	Because math class is fun, Tim.
00:31:02	SN	Oh, no.
00:31:03	SN	Oh, I get it.
00:31:04	SN	I just like math.
00:31:06	T	No, it's not really three times as long. They're all the same, but- that was just an-
00:31:10	SN	I thought fifth period was the longest?
00:31:11	SN	Yeah.
00:31:12	T	Okay. Well we have an extra 10 minutes because we read, but that's all.
00:31:16	T	Okay. What we're doing there, is we're taking words and translating them into variable expressions.
00:31:26	T	Now, there's two parts to that. Taking words and putting them into numbers or the opposite.
00:31:35	T	So people, if you're sitting at your desk taking notes, write the opposite. You don't have to write both of those things up there.
00:31:41	T	As long as you understand. Remember, you don't have to write everything I write.
00:31:46	T	Take words, change them into numbers. Take numbers and change them into words.
00:31:53	SN	You can do one of those?
00:31:55	T	Yeah, and then just write either opposite or vice versa.
00:32:06	T	I'm gonna give you an- some examples.
00:32:14	SN	Wait-
00:32:33	T	Okay. Say I give you the words, a number plus negative three. How would I take those words from a word phrase-
00:32:48	T	Now this example is on page one-o-six, people, so you have your choice here.
00:32:52	T	How do I take the words, a number plus negative three and make it a variable expression? Patrick?
00:33:02	SN	A plus negative three.
00:33:03	T	Okay. A plus negative three. You chose A. I chose N. Again, the letter doesn't matter.
00:33:11	T	So we took a word phrase and changed it from words to a variable expression. I'm going to give you another- Yes?
00:33:22	SN	Why'd you put the parenthesis around negative three?
00:33:25	T	Good question. Why'd I put these here? Only because you don't get mixed up with the signs. If I put-
00:33:32	SS	Oh.
00:33:33	T	Okay? I don't- That's why I do it that way. Andrea?
00:33:37	SN	Do you have to put it down there?
00:33:38	T	You don't have to but I think it's- it makes it clearer to see. Okay? Tim?
00:33:45	SN	Would it make a difference if we put it around N plus or not?
00:33:49	T	Well, in this case, we have two operation signs technically, so that's why we- I did it here. Marcus?
00:33:57	SN	What if you switched it around (inaudible) negative three before?
00:34:00	T	Before N?
00:34:01	S	Yeah.
00:34:02	T	That would work okay. But it's- but- It's backwards here from what the words are.
00:34:06	S	Oh.
00:34:07	T	Technically in math that's not incorrect. Yes?
00:34:10	SN	So a number means like you put a letter?
00:34:14	T	Yes. That's the variable part of it. Any letter.
00:34:17	S	So that means- oh.
00:34:19	T	Okay, what if I say six less than a number. Six less than a number. Michelle?
00:34:32	SN	Six minus N.
00:34:34	T	Six minus N. What do you think Aubrey?
00:34:36	SN	N minus six.
00:34:38	T	Why do you think that?
00:34:39	S	Oh because-
00:34:41	T	You're right. Tell me why.
00:34:42	S	Six is less than the number?
00:34:44	T	Right. Do you see the difference? Six less than a number.
00:34:47	SN	Oh.
00:34:49	T	Yours was a number less than six. What you gave me. This will- that's the tricky saying right there. Questions so far?
00:35:03	T	Alex?
00:35:05	SN	So then when it says "less than" in, like, a question, you always minus the number from the letter?
00:35:10	SN	Like go, the letter minus the number?
00:35:14	T	I hate when I say "always", Alex. Uh, nine times out of 10, yes, but there may be like something else here.
00:35:21	T	Like may- it may say two plus a number then less than. So you've got to be careful. It's not always. Okay. Yes?
00:35:31	SN	Who did- do you have to put the parenthesis around the minus six or would that be considered a negative six?
00:35:38	T	Well in here there's not another sign so it doesn't matter here.
00:35:43	T	Well, we're going to learn next week that it's- negative- this also does mean minus.
00:35:48	T	But we don't need to put parenthesis here because there's not another sign, okay?
00:35:54	T	All right. Now, we're going to do it the other way. We're going to start with a variable expression and go to words.
00:36:01	T	Start with the variable and go to words. So I'm going to give you this time- Yes?
00:36:09	SN	Is this in the book too (inaudible)?
00:36:11	T	Yeah. This is still all page one-o-six.
00:36:14	T	K divided by eight. Try to write that in words without using the word divided. Can anybody do that? Jen?
00:36:22	SN	K over eight.
00:36:23	T	Okay. That's- Steve?
00:36:25	SN	K into eight.
00:36:26	T	Okay. Well no. That would be eight into K.
00:36:29	S	Oh.
00:36:30	T	Christy?
00:36:31	SN	K of eight.
00:36:32	T	No. What does "of" mean in that?
00:36:34	S	Oh.
00:36:36	T	Times. Okay? It's okay, you're thinking.
00:36:39	T	All of those- what Jen and Steve were correct, I chose the big math word, quotient.
00:36:46	T	K divided by eight, the quotient of the number and eight.
00:36:51	T	What if I gave you 15 minus B? Fifteen minus B. Patrick?
00:37:00	SN	Fifteen less than B. Or less- B less than 15.
00:37:04	T	B less than 15 would work. I chose an easier route. Fifteen minus a number.
00:37:12	T	Either one is correct. Questions so far on this, people?
00:37:22	T	Any questions?
00:37:28	T	Andrea?
00:37:29	SN	What does quotient mean?
00:37:30	T	Quotient means divided. See my- my sign up there in the corner has all the math words. Okay.
00:37:38	T	Okay. The last thing then, variable expressions with more than one operation. Use the order of operations.
00:37:46	T	What does that mean? Order of operations. Alex?
00:37:52	SN	Uh, says sub- well take- Substitute words and change them into numbers.
00:38:04	T	Well kind of, but I mean here. Do you remember back what order of operations means Jen?
00:38:09	SN	PEMDAS.
00:38:10	T	What's that mean?
00:38:11	S	Parenthesis, exponent, multiplication, division and addition and subtraction.
00:38:14	T	Very good. And what's the saying that goes along with that?
00:38:17	SN	I know. I know.
00:38:19	T	Jen?
00:38:20	SN	Please Excuse My Dear Aunt Sally.
00:38:22	T	Aubrey what's please mean?
00:38:24	SN	Oh, parenthesis.
00:38:26	T	No, not actually please, but I mean- parenthesis. Class. Excuse. What's that mean?
00:38:32	SS	Exponent.
00:38:33	T	My?
00:38:34	SS	Multiplication.
00:38:36	T	Dear?
00:38:37	SS	Division.
00:38:38	T	Aunt.
00:38:39	SS	Addition.
00:38:41	T	Sally.
00:38:42	SS	Subtraction.
00:38:44	T	Okay. Good. So that's what we do here. An example, evaluate one point five plus two N for N equals 12.
00:38:52	T	How do I do that? Patrick?
00:38:57	SN	You do the multiplication first. But put the- you put 12 in for N and then you do the multiplication and then you add.
00:39:05	T	Good. Alex?
00:39:06	SN	Or you could substitute N for 12 and put quotations around-
00:39:12	T	Parenthesis.
00:39:13	S	Yeah, parenthesis around N 12 so you know how to do those first.
00:39:16	T	Good. Jen?
00:39:17	SN	What about for us in the example that says, uh, a number plus a negative three.
00:39:23	S	Wouldn't you have to do something with those parenthesis though, 'cause that's the order of operations.
00:39:27	T	Right. So you would- you would have to take it out of there.
00:39:31	T	So, next week- we haven't gotten to this yet, but plus a negative, depending on what this is. That's a good point. Yes. Marcus?
00:39:38	SN	I have a question. Is that one point five?
00:39:40	T	Yes. One point five plus two N.
00:39:44	T	So Patrick said put 12 N for N. Class what's two times 12?
00:39:49	SS	Twenty-four.
00:39:51	T	Plus one point five gives us twenty-five point five.
00:39:55	SN	Is this all in our notes?
00:39:56	T	Yes, Brandon.
00:39:57	S	Yes.
00:39:59	T	Once you've finished writing I'd like you to take out your textbooks quietly.
00:40:23	T	Remember, if you don't have a book please share. And open to page one-o-seven please. Page one-o-seven.
00:40:46	T	Okay. Above number seven, somebody raise their hand and read the directions for me please. Above number seven. Michelle.
00:40:56	SN	Write a variable expression for each quantity. Explain what the variable represents
00:41:03	T	Good. Page one-o-seven. So we're going to write a variable and then explain what it is. Look at number seven.
00:41:11	T	Kim's height if she's six inches shorter than her mother. What would a variable expression be? Steve?
00:41:20	SN	Like N... N minus negative six?
00:41:29	T	No, just N minus six.
00:41:30	S	N minus six.
00:41:31	T	Good. What does N represent?
00:41:34	S	Her mom's height.
00:41:35	T	Good. How about number eight. The number of calories in three slices of bread? Patrick?
00:41:43	SN	Uh, C times three.
00:41:45	T	Or how else could you say that?
00:41:47	SN	Three times C.
00:41:48	T	Andrea?
00:41:49	SN	Three C.
00:41:50	T	Three C. Okay. Look at- look at number nine. Mike's age if Mike is three years older than Jill. Ryan?
00:42:02	SN	Three X.
00:42:04	T	No. That would be multiply. Wouldn't it? Think- think about that one again.
00:42:08	S	Plus X.
00:42:09	T	So what would it be?
00:42:10	S	Three plus X.
00:42:11	T	Okay, good. What's X represent?
00:42:13	S	Jill.
00:42:14	T	Jill. Jill's age. Good. Go down to number 11. Twice a number. What would that be? Twice a number. Alex?
00:42:23	SN	N two.
00:42:24	T	Or how could we say that?
00:42:26	S	Two N.
00:42:27	T	Two N. Alex, always put the number first. Okay? Look at number 14.
00:42:32	T	The quotient of three divided by W. There's that word Andrea. Quotient of three divided by W. Marcus.
00:42:39	SN	W over three. Or three over W.
00:42:42	T	Three over W. Okay. And one more, 16. Seventeen less than N. Michelle?
00:42:50	SN	N minus 17.
00:42:52	T	Good. N minus 17 is correct. Okay. Quietly put your books away. I'm going to pass out your homework.
00:43:01	SN	Oh, do we- on our homework, uh-
00:43:02	T	Shh.
00:43:07	T	Brandon let me explain it. I'll tell you. Okay class, quiet please.
00:43:18	T	Where do you think we use variable expressions in real life? Patrick?
00:43:27	SN	When you're trying to figure out all the problems.
00:43:31	T	Okay. Marcus?
00:43:33	SN	Uh-
00:43:36	T	How many of you have science this semester? Where do you use variable expressions in science? Formulas. Steve?
00:43:47	SN	When you're trying to figure out like, how much something weighs.
00:43:51	T	Okay. You have to substitute something in. Okay.
00:43:52	S	Yeah.
00:43:55	T	How about- Yes, Patrick?
00:43:57	SN	When you're trying to convert uh, measurements.
00:44:00	T	Very good. Jen?
00:44:01	SN	When you're trying to find the price of clothes or something.
00:44:04	T	Very good. That's another way. Yes.
00:44:05	SN	Like, in science like when you try- try to find density.
00:44:10	T	Okay. The density formula. Good.
00:44:13	T	Okay, somebody raise your hand and read the homework board to me please. Andrea?
00:44:20	SN	Page 64 from workbook, Xerox copy numbers one to 22, do all of them. And a quiz on Friday.
00:44:28	T	Okay, good. There are two extra. Please give to Vince and John.
00:44:40	T	Okay. Take a minute and look over your homework. Please do a couple and then I'll have you pack up. Yes?
00:44:51	SN	For number one through 16, you don't have to write the answer?
00:44:55	T	I'm not sure what you mean. Write a variable expression- Oh. It doesn't say evaluate.
00:45:01	S	Oh yeah.
00:45:02	T	Yeah, just write the expression.
00:45:03	SN	There's an extra (inaudible).
00:45:05	T	Could you pass it forward, John? Pass that forward please. Thank you John. Brandon?
00:45:11	SN	On, uh, on number one do you have to have- do you have to put the number before you, uh, subtraction?
00:45:16	T	No. That one has to be accurate. So like-
00:45:18	S	So it would be like five subtract, uh, any number you- any letter you want to?
00:45:19	T	Thank you.
00:45:24	T	Yes. Any letter. Yes. Yes?
00:45:26	SN	On number two it says, the absolute value do you have to put the lines in?
00:45:32	T	What do you think?
00:45:33	S	Yes.
00:45:34	T	Yes.
00:45:35	S	But do you like put an N?
00:45:36	T	Yeah. You put it around N. Good question Michelle.
00:45:52	T	Yes?
00:45:53	SN	For number five do you have to put two expressions because it says, uh, says three more than the product.
00:46:00	T	Yes. Yes. No, into one expression but use- so three more than the product.
00:46:07	T	What would the product of eight and a number be?
00:46:09	S	So wouldn't it be like X-
00:46:10	T	Well, use a times because that looks like a variable. Okay?
00:46:14	S	So- What should I use?
00:46:16	T	Shh. Please John, please work.
00:46:19	S	So then eight, and equals...
00:46:22	T	Eight- No, plus-
00:46:24	S	Plus-
00:46:25	T	Plus three, right? Because that's three more than.
00:46:28	S	Okay.
00:46:29	T	Okay. Marcus?
00:46:31	SN	I have a question on, like, number three.
00:46:34	T	Okay, I'll be right there. Josh what's your question?
00:46:37	SN	How do you solve this?
00:46:39	T	What's the product of the number and negative eight? What does product mean?
00:46:42	S	Multiplication.
00:46:44	T	Okay, so how would you do that?
00:46:45	S	Uh... I don't know.
00:46:48	T	What are you multiplying here?
00:46:50	S	Negative eight.
00:46:51	T	And?
00:46:52	S	A number.
00:46:53	T	Okay, so how would we do that?
00:46:54	S	Negative eight N.
00:46:56	T	Good.
00:46:57	S	All right.
00:46:58	T	Very good.
00:46:59	SN	What's the answer?
00:47:00	T	Okay, hang on. Let me get Marcus. Yes?
00:47:02	SN	All right, I have no clue what to put first.
00:47:04	T	All right. What does product mean?
00:47:06	S	Like the answer to a number.
00:47:08	T	What kind of operation are we using for product?
00:47:12	S	Multiplication.
00:47:13	T	Good. So what are we multiplying here?
00:47:15	S	Uh, negative eight.
00:47:16	T	And?
00:47:18	S	Negative eight and... P. And the product of-
00:47:23	T	Well-
00:47:24	S	So, is it negative eight?
00:47:25	T	Times?
00:47:26	S	P. So, negative.
00:47:27	T	Yeah, negative eight P would be good. Alex do you have a question?
00:47:35	SN	(inaudible) sum of the quarters.
00:47:38	T	Okay.
00:47:39	S	It would be?
