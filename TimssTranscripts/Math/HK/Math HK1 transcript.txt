00:00:06	T	Okay, page 161. Uh, we have learned something about the square, do you remember?
00:00:14	SS	No.
00:00:15	T	No? So uh, we have learned- for example, I give you a... question for you to think about.
00:00:22	T	So first of all, what is... the square... of three?
00:00:32	T	What is the square of three? So- so that you may understand what is the square of.
00:00:38	SN	Six, six.
00:00:41	SN	Six.
00:00:42	T	So what is the answer?
00:00:43	SS	Six.
00:00:43	SN	Nine. Nine.
00:00:44	T	Six? Yes? Uh, Leung Chi Fu.
00:00:48	S	Nine.
00:00:49	T	Nine, yes. So uh, we can answer the question like that- the square of three... is equal to nine- nine.
00:00:51	SN	Right. [In Chinese]
00:00:59	T	So you can show the step. What is the square of nine?
00:01:03	T	You can use mathnotics- sorry, mathematical notation. How to write the square of three? Fung Chi Pui.
00:01:10	SN	Three times three.
00:01:11	T	Three times three. And then, there is a step, the square of three.
00:01:17	T	So, can you write a mathematical notation? Uh, Mung Wing Chi.
00:01:25	SN	The square.
00:01:26	T	The square of three? So that- can you write it on the blackboard?
00:01:28	SS	[Laughter] (inaudible)
00:01:31	SN	Are you tall enough? [In Chinese]
00:01:32	SN	Are you tall enough? [In Chinese]
00:01:33	SN	Wow, so long. [In Chinese]
00:01:34	T	Very big. Yes. Uh, the square of three, you can write, uh, at the same as this.
00:01:40	T	So that it- the meaning of uh, square of three is equal to three times three. So the answer is nine, okay?
00:01:47	T	So, what is the square of negative three?
00:01:57	T	Negative three. So can you show the step? Okay, the first- the first line, what do you- what do you write? Wong On Kei.
00:02:12	T	The first line.
00:02:19	T	Okay. So, have you found out- there's something missing.
00:02:22	T	So you must write down- what do you- what did you find out? What did you find?
00:02:27	T	Okay, uh, next. Oh, you- you can answer it again.
00:02:37	T	The square of...
00:02:45	T	Negative three. So, the square of negative three, you can write like this. And then, square means?
00:02:53	T	What's the- what's the meaning of square? So the answer- next step, what do you write? Ng Hoi Yan.
00:03:02	T	Can you answer me?
00:03:03	SN	I want to write.
00:03:05	T	Okay.
00:03:10	T	Neg- negative three times negative three. Okay? So the answer is- what's the answer? You can answer me.
00:03:20	T	Uh, orally, so uh, Chan Wai Yan.
00:03:23	SN	Nine.
00:03:24	T	Nine.
00:03:27	T	Okay, now uh, we will learn another- another type of question.
00:03:56	T	Okay. Now, what is the positive value of A if the square of A is nine?
00:04:08	T	So can you find the answers? So what is the positive value of nine? Law Oi Ping.
00:04:15	SN	Three.
00:04:15	T	Three. So how can you do that?
00:04:19	T	How can you- how can you find the answers?
00:04:21	T	So first of all, you must express the square of A equals nine. So you can write an equation about A and nine.
00:04:30	T	So, can- what do you write on the left hand side? Wong Chun Kei.
00:04:35	SN	A times A.
00:04:37	T	A times A. Or?
00:04:39	S	Three squared.
00:04:41	T	Yes, write the little two on the top. The square of A equals nine, okay?
00:04:48	T	So then now, we want to find A. So some of you say, the answer is three.
00:04:53	T	So I- I think you can go- oh three times three is nine, so the answer is three.
00:04:59	T	Uh, I will teach you a step to solve. So, uh, if you find the- uh, the value of A, you can write like this.
00:05:06	T	So A, you want to find A, then this side, you put square root, okay? So this sign- this signs...
00:05:15	T	We call it radical signs. Radical sign, okay? Radical sign.
00:05:21	T	So what is the meaning of this radical sign? So the meaning is the same as this sentence. Okay?
00:05:29	T	Square root of nine means to find a positive value of A, A huh, if the square of A is nine, okay?
00:05:39	T	Square root of nine- to find a value.
00:05:43	T	To find a positive value.
00:05:46	T	Its square equals to nine. Okay?
00:05:50	T	Do you know- do you understand what's the- what is the meaning of square root of a number?
00:05:56	T	Yes, okay. So now, number two.
00:06:02	T	What is the negative... value of A if the square of A is nine?
00:06:17	T	So the result is the same, the square of A is nine. But now, you want to find the negative number.
00:06:23	T	Can you find the answer?
00:06:25	SN	Yes.
00:06:31	T	Yeung Suk Ping.
00:06:32	SN	Negative three.
00:06:34	T	Negative three. So how can you find that? How can you find that?
00:06:38	T	So first of all, if the square of A is nine, then you can write an equation.
00:06:44	T	So, can you write an equation for me?
00:06:50	T	Lo Chi Hung.
00:06:59	T	So now, in this question, you want to find the negative value of A.
00:07:03	T	What is the difference? What is the difference between this part and the- and the previous question?
00:07:16	T	Good. [In Chinese]
00:07:18	T	But now A, A is a negative number, not negati- negative A.
00:07:25	T	So the square of A- the square of A is nine. Yes.
00:07:31	T	Haha. Is there any question? If the square of A, so which number? The square of which number?
00:07:40	SS	[Laughter]
00:07:50	T	The square of A. You just write this sentence as a- as an equation, as an equation.
00:07:52	SN	The square of A is [in Chinese] A.
00:07:56	SN	Why? [In Chinese]
00:07:59	T	Yes, good. Okay, so A- uh, square of A equals nine.
00:08:04	T	So now, you will- you know that, the answer is negative three. Why? Because you- you know.
00:08:13	T	Because you know that, negative three times negative three equals nine.
00:08:18	T	So negative three squared equals nine.
00:08:20	T	So the answer, compared of this equation, A is negative three, okay?
00:08:26	T	So now, can we, uh, show the step like this?
00:08:30	T	So, first of all, what is the difference? So A is equal to the square root of nine. Is it the same?
00:08:40	SS	No.
00:08:40	T	No, so you must add...
00:08:42	SN	Neg- negative.
00:08:42	O	[Bell]
00:08:44	T	Kwong Wai Kit.
00:08:48	T	Yes, just- just talk.
00:08:50	S	Uh, a negative (inaudible) equation.
00:08:51	SS	[Laughter]
00:08:55	T	Another sign?
00:08:56	S	Uh.
00:08:57	T	In...
00:08:58	SN	He wants to be on camera. [In Chinese]
00:08:59	SS	[Laughter]
00:09:00	T	Yes, in here. Okay? Negative sign in front of the square root.
00:09:05	T	So if you want to find the negative value, then in- in front of the, uh, square root-
00:09:12	T	Before the square root, you write a negative sign.
00:09:16	T	So that you can get the answer is negative three. Okay?
00:09:19	T	So now, I want you to find this question. So nega- square root of 36.
00:09:30	T	Can you find the answers? So square root of 36, what is the answer?
00:09:34	T	So square root of 36 means- find a number.
00:09:40	T	The square of this number equals 36. So which number?
00:09:46	SN	Six.
00:09:48	T	Choi Ka Yan.
00:09:48	SN	Six.
00:09:49	T	Six, okay? And then, negative square root of 36. So the answer is... Woo Hau Pang?
00:09:57	SN	Negative six.
00:09:58	T	Negative six. Okay.
00:10:01	T	Open your book to page 162 to do question number two in your book.
00:10:12	T	Page one hundred and sixty-two, number two.
00:10:24	SN	(inaudible)
00:10:34	T	(inaudible)
00:11:42	SN	[Laughter]
00:11:45	SN	(inaudible)
00:12:08	T	Okay.
00:12:18	T	Okay, part two A. Square root of 36 is six. We have done it before. Okay, part B.
00:12:24	T	Square root of 49. What is the answer?
00:12:29	T	Ng Ka Wing.
00:12:30	SN	Seven.
00:12:31	T	Seven. Yes. Part C. Square root of 100. So the answer is...
00:12:37	T	Cheung Ka Wai.
00:12:38	SN	Ten.
00:12:40	T	Ten, because 10 squared equals 100, okay? And then uh, part D.
00:12:46	T	Square root of 196, so the answer is...?
00:12:53	T	To Tsung Him.
00:12:54	SN	Thirteen. Fourteen.
00:12:56	T	Fourteen. Fourteen, yes. Okay. Part E. What is the- what is the answer?
00:13:03	T	Wong Yee Hung- sorry, Wong Yee Ling.
00:13:06	T	Seventeen. Next.
00:13:10	T	Part F. So the answer is... Lui Man Hing?
00:13:14	SN	Twelve.
00:13:14	T	Twelve.
00:13:16	SS	No!
00:13:16	T	Mm?
00:13:18	SN	Twenty.
00:13:19	T	Twenty.
00:13:19	SS	[Laughter]
00:13:20	T	Twenty, yes. Okay, uh, part G, part G. So the answer is... Choi Ka Man?
00:13:27	T	Hmm?
00:13:27	SN	Thirteen.
00:13:28	T	Thirteen, yes. Thirteen. Okay, H? The answer is...?
00:13:36	SS	[Laughter]
00:13:40	T	Uh, Wong On Tin.
00:13:41	SN	Nine.
00:13:42	T	Nine? Nineteen. Nineteen. Okay, I? What is the answer? Wong Wai Yan.
00:13:49	T	Chan Wai Yan.
00:13:50	SS	[Laughter]
00:13:50	SN	Negative (inaudible).
00:13:51	T	Huh?
00:13:52	S	Negative 11.
00:13:53	T	Negative 11. Okay, your last one. What is the answer?
00:13:59	T	So Chi Yan.
00:14:02	SN	Why are you thinking about it for so long? [In Chinese]
00:14:03	T	Negative... four.
00:14:06	T	So you must know that, if uh, a- A squared is equal to nine, there is two- sorry, there are two answers.
00:14:13	T	There are two answers... to make uh, A squared equal to nine.
00:14:17	T	The values of A may be positive three or negative three. Why?
00:14:23	T	Because negative three times negative three is nine. And three times three is also equal to nine. Okay?
00:14:31	T	So there are two answers.
00:14:33	T	So if- uh, before the square root, there is uh- there is no sign, it shows it is a positive.
00:14:41	T	If, in front of the square root sign, there is a negative then the answer is negative.
00:14:48	T	Okay? Do you know- do you know how to express?
00:14:52	T	Okay. So now, we'll go to another... question.
00:14:56	T	If now, I want to find what is the value of, uh, A if the square of A is nine.
00:15:05	T	Now, I'm- I just want to find the values of A. I only to uh- I- I want to find the value of A.
00:15:12	T	Okay? But now uh- is- is there any request about A? A must be positive or negative?
00:15:21	T	No. So how do we wri- write this?
00:15:24	T	So in this case, it's similar. A squared equal to nine because it is given that the square of A is nine.
00:15:32	T	Next, so we know that there are- there are two answers. So how to write this? So A...
00:15:40	T	The- one of the answer is negative nine or...?
00:15:48	T	There are two answers, one of these is square root of nine. The other...? The other is...?
00:16:01	T	La- Lai Chi Fu.
00:16:05	SN	Negative. [In Chinese]
00:16:06	T	Negative... square... root...
00:16:11	S	Square root of nine.
00:16:12	T	Of nine. Okay. So that means square root of nine. So you just combine the two questions, okay?
00:16:18	T	So before, uh, if it is positive, then it is positive square root of nine.
00:16:24	T	So, this is the positive square root of nine.
00:16:27	T	And then this one, you want to find a negative, then there is a negative. It's the same, okay?
00:16:33	T	So in this case, you can find the answer, this is equal to one and then this is equal to negative three.
00:16:40	T	So if in the question, uh, you- you want to find, uh, the value of A...
00:16:46	T	And then, you know A may be positive or negative, so you can express like this.
00:16:52	T	So there are two answers.
00:16:55	T	Do you have any questions? If there is no question, please do it by yourself.
00:16:59	SN	Ah.
00:17:00	T	Yes, do it in your classwork.
00:17:53	T	Okay, find this- do these two classworks okay? Two questions.
00:17:59	T	So each of uh- each of the questions, you can find two answers, okay?
00:18:05	T	Two answers in each question.
00:18:38	SN	(inaudible)
00:18:53	T	(inaudible)
00:18:56	T	Okay. Quick.
00:19:16	T	Because there are two answers. (inaudible)
00:19:26	SN	(inaudible)
00:19:26	T	Did you get two answers?
00:19:33	T	There are two possible answers.
00:19:46	T	Okay, who can do this for us? Okay, number four?
00:20:00	SS	[Laughter]
00:20:00	T	Leung Hoi Chung.
00:20:06	T	Number five?
00:20:09	T	Uh... Ng Chun Mei.
00:20:27	SN	You're kidding.
00:20:47	SN	(inaudible)
00:20:58	T	(inaudible)
00:21:05	T	Okay, uh, number four, so you- you write this e- equation to express this, uh, condition.
00:21:12	T	So the square of A equals 64.
00:21:15	T	So A equals the square root of 64. This is to represent a positive value, okay?
00:21:20	T	Or negative square root of 64.
00:21:25	T	So this you can find the answer is eight. This, you can get the answer negative eight.
00:21:29	T	So there are two answers because eight times eight is 64.
00:21:35	T	Negative eight times negative eight is 64. So there are two answers, okay?
00:21:41	T	And then, for this case, it is correct, okay?
00:21:45	T	In this case, you do not need to write it, uh- this sentence again- this equation again.
00:21:51	T	Do you have any questions?
00:21:57	T	Okay. There are some things for you to think about.
00:22:17	T	Okay.
00:22:22	SS	[Laughter]
00:22:28	T	Okay, think... think about, uh, square root of negative four- sorry, square root of the square of negative four.
00:22:37	T	Is it equal to four or equal to negative four?
00:22:48	T	Lo Chi Hung.
00:22:49	SN	Four.
00:22:50	T	Four. Why?
00:22:52	SN	Four
00:22:53	SS	Four. Four.
00:22:55	SN	Negative four times negative four is- it is equal to 16 and square root of 16 is four.
00:23:00	T	Yes, very good.
00:23:04	T	Yes, very good.
00:23:05	T	So, this square root of the square of negative four, you can express-
00:23:13	T	the number inside, you can expand it as- you can calculate.
00:23:17	T	Negative- the square of negative four is equal to negative four times negative four.
00:23:22	T	So it is equal to positive 16.
00:23:26	T	So in this case, the answer...
00:23:30	T	Is it equal- equal to negative- negative four?
00:23:32	SN	No.
00:23:33	T	Why? Because there is no negative sign in the front. So, the answer must be positive, okay?
00:23:42	T	So in this case, you can see that the answer is positive.
00:23:47	T	You can- you can find the answer is positive if there is no sign. Okay?
00:23:53	T	If the answer is negative, only if there is a negative sign, uh, before the square root, okay?
00:24:04	T	So in this case, there is no negative- negative sign...
00:24:08	T	Uh, uh, in the front, so, we call- uh, we can find the answer positive. We can find a positive answer.
00:24:18	T	Do you have any questions?
00:24:20	T	Okay. Now, uh, we have another question for- for- uh, for you to think about. Uh, it is this.
00:24:51	SN	No solution.
00:24:51	T	Okay.
00:24:52	SN	No solution.
00:24:57	T	Okay, wait a min- wait a minute for you to think about this.
00:25:02	T	So, this, uh, square root of a- sorry, uh, negative- sorry, square root of negative four.
00:25:09	T	Is it equal to two, or negative two, or no solution?
00:25:13	SS	No solution, no solution.
00:25:16	T	Okay. Who says that it is equal to two?
00:25:19	SS	[Laughter]
00:25:19	T	Put up your hand.
00:25:24	T	Why? Because take square root means- what is the number times itself equal to negative four?
00:25:31	T	So two times two is four.
00:25:33	T	So it- it does not equal negative four. It is- it does not equal negative four.
00:25:38	T	How about negative two? So this answer is incorrect. How about this?
00:25:45	T	Is it correct?
00:25:46	SS	[Laughter]
00:25:46	T	Do you think this is correct? Please put up your hand.
00:25:49	T	Why? Because negative two times negative two... equals...?
00:25:56	SS	Four.
00:25:56	T	Four. So it does not equal negative four.
00:26:00	T	So, there is...?
00:26:02	SS	No solution.
00:26:02	T	No solution.
00:26:04	T	Why? Because, uh, if you find that it is, uh, just like that, A squared is equal to negative four.
00:26:11	T	So which number times itself is equal to a negative number?
00:26:15	SS	None.
00:26:15	T	None. Because a number A- all number can be, uh, divided or grouped into three- uh, must be one of these.
00:26:23	T	One is positive.
00:26:26	T	One is...?
00:26:27	SS	Negative.
00:26:28	T	Negative. Or...
00:26:29	SN	No solution.
00:26:31	T	No solution. No.
00:26:33	T	A number must be one of- one of- one of these. Maybe it is a positive. Maybe it is negative, or...?
00:26:42	SS	Zero.
00:26:43	T	Zero, yes. Very good.
00:26:44	T	So uh, if A squared- we see, uh- by case, so if A is positive, then what is the value of A squared?
00:26:54	T	Positive? Negative? Or zero?
00:26:58	SS	Positive.
00:26:59	T	Positive. And then if it is negative, what is the result of the square of A?
00:27:05	SS	Positive.
00:27:05	T	Positive. If it is zero, then what is the squ- square of zero?
00:27:09	SS	Zero.
00:27:10	T	Zero. So is there any answer equal to negative?
00:27:13	SS	No.
00:27:14	T	No. So, this answer- this neg- uh, negative four, you cannot find the answers. Okay?
00:27:21	T	Because, all the square...
00:27:24	T	All the square, you cannot find the negative result.
00:27:28	T	Do you have any questions? No.
00:27:31	T	So uh, in this case, we just, uh, learned something about the meaning of the square root.
00:27:37	T	So that's- what is this meaning of square root?
00:27:39	T	So, take square root of nine is to find the number of A such that the square of A is equal to nine.
00:27:47	T	So you just take the square root of nine to find the answer.
00:27:52	T	And then, uh, if A squared is equal to A, then there are two values.
00:27:57	T	So, in this case, it solves the answer is- the answer is positive.
00:28:01	T	If this one, there is a negative sign, then the answer is negative.
00:28:06	T	Okay?
00:28:08	T	Finally, there are some, uh, uh, special, uh, questions for you to think about.
00:28:14	T	So you must think carefully that, uh, this answer must be positive because there is no negative sign.
00:28:21	T	This one... because inside there is a negative number, then it is- it is, uh- there is no solution.
00:28:31	T	Okay, if there is no, uh, questions,
00:28:33	T	uh, please go home to read page 163 to page 164.
