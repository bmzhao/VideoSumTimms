00:00:05	T	All right, good morning everybody.
00:00:07	E	Good morning.
00:00:09	T	Well, let's imagine today to- eh, we are getting closer to Christmas time.
00:00:14	T	We want to send a present to our friends. A present that has a long and narrow shape.
00:00:22	T	It could be a thin straw, it could be I don't know-
00:00:27	T	Has anybody an idea? I heard that- Joel you were about to say something?
00:00:30	SN	No, no, no, nothing
00:00:32	T	No idea? A long and narrow object. So we ask at the post office, has anybody noticed,
00:00:38	T	at the post office there are boxes with different shapes. And these are the six shapes you can see over there.
00:00:44	T	There is box number zero, box number one, number two, three, four,
00:00:51	T	and five, and those boxes have different shapes determined by the post office.
00:00:57	T	Now ever- every group- you sit together in groups of three and one group of two-
00:01:02	T	will receive a box. Start observing this box a little bit, there are
00:01:08	T	some instructions in common that they give together with the box. Look to see what
00:01:13	T	your box number is, the measurements, the dimensions of that box.
00:01:17	T	And then take one of these straws, try to find out the position in which the straw
00:01:25	T	can be placed to obtain the longest straw. That means you insert the
00:01:30	T	whole straw, it's very possible that it doesn't fit even in the biggest box,
00:01:34	T	and try to obtain the longest straw by cutting the straw from the start
00:01:41	T	of the point in which you think you received the longest straw.
00:01:44	T	That means to insert it that way, insert it horizontally. Try to find out which is
00:01:49	T	the longest straw that you can thread into this box. Once you have found out
00:01:54	T	the position in which the straw is the longest, cut it-
00:01:58	T	cut it, you can keep the rest of the straw if it helps you for further observations you can
00:02:03	T	also cut it. Measure it, you have a tape measure, you have a ruler, measure the maximum length that you can obtain.
00:02:14	T	At this point you have a measure. Check with the calculations if the measure you found is correct.
00:02:23	T	To do this, you have to observe the box a little bit and see how you can find
00:02:28	T	the length of this straw. The calculations, do them, eh, one copy per group.
00:02:35	T	Write a draft of your calculations trying out the reasoning that you need.
00:02:40	T	Then everybody will receive a worksheet and will complete the space where the number of your
00:02:47	T	box is, by writing the solution that you have found. After each group is done, I'll pass by and
00:02:54	T	you will complete a transparency with the results you have found. Therefore the materials that you
00:02:59	T	need are: Calculator, mmh, a draft sheet per group. And you work in
00:03:04	T	groups of three or two. Only one person can move the chair, okay?
00:03:31	SN	Thanks.
00:03:32	T	You're welcome.
00:03:39	SN	To do the calculations you have to find (inaudible) calculations so that you can find this measure of the straw?
00:03:43	T	Yes.
00:04:10	SN	Madam, but- and when is not (inaudible).
00:04:13	T	(inaudible)
00:04:49	T	Also observe your instructions a little bit, eh?
00:05:06	S	Madam, can we already cut it?
00:05:07	T	Of course you can already cut it, yes.
00:05:14	SN	Madam, Madam, can we (inaudible)?
00:05:17	T	No.
00:05:25	T	Cut the straw already. Have you found the best position?
00:05:28	SN	Eh, (inaudible).
00:05:34	T	Well, cut it.
00:05:36	SN	And if it's wrong?
00:05:36	T	In case it's wrong you take another piece and then you use the rest of the straw.
00:05:48	SN	Eh, it's forty point five.
00:05:53	SN	Eh, yes.
00:06:09	SN	You do it that way?
00:06:10	SN	Put it a little (inaudible).
00:06:11	SN	You measure forty?
00:06:12	SN	Forty point five.
00:06:12	SN	Well, well, this is the length (inaudible).
00:06:18	T	Look, you have instructions, eh, that are already given.
00:06:21	SN	Ah, already.
00:06:26	T	Try to cut it and then if it doesn't work you'll take another piece of straw and- try.
00:06:31	SN	We only cut one piece.
00:06:33	T	Find the longest straw that you can place in your box, m-hm, yes.
00:06:36	SN	Madam, like this it's longer (inaudible).
00:06:40	SN	(inaudible) calculate it like this.
00:06:42	T	Try to think about- it isn't that complicated.
00:07:00	T	So did you already cut the straw?
00:07:02	SS	No.
00:07:04	T	Go on, cut it and also if you fail, you can do it again. Look, you have already got the- the instructions.
00:07:11	SN	Yes, yes, but we have already found-
00:07:12	SN	We have already found it.
00:07:14	T	You have it already- then- okay. Complete the sheet.
00:07:17	S	But don't we have to do the calculations?
00:07:21	SN	We- we've got it
00:07:22	T	You have inserted, cut and measured it.
00:07:25	S	Yes.
00:07:25	T	Okay. Then now you can try with the calculations to check if this length corresponds to what you have measured.
00:07:36	S	(inaudible) the diagonal like this so (inaudible).
00:07:44	T	So complete: Here with your situation, with your straw, you have the box number two and you put it- do it again here.
00:07:56	SN	Ah, we have to do-
00:07:57	T	And then start doing this, call me to have a look at it when you've finished.
00:08:00	SN	Like this, Madam (inaudible).
00:08:05	T	Now have you found the straw and have you measured it?
00:08:07	SS	Yes.
00:08:07	T	Now observe the box then put it aside.
00:08:15	T	Insert the straw: What- if I- so in your opinion, what is the longest straw laying in the box?
00:08:26	SN	No, no shorter.
00:08:27	SN	Shorter.
00:08:33	T	One that's shorter.
00:08:35	SN	Like this.
00:08:37	T	So in reality I could take a very shallow box, if I place the straw
00:08:42	T	that way- a very shallow box, it's of no use that the box is that high.
00:08:46	T	Could I have it low like this? (inaudible) a box this big but it's of no use.
00:08:54	T	Try to think about if you somehow can use the fact that it
00:08:57	T	is high, that you have a box high like this.
00:09:03	T	If not, I'll give you another straw, if you need one.
00:09:08	SN	We have finished.
00:09:08	SN	We have finished.
00:09:09	T	So, then. Try to complete this sheet. Everybody has his own.
00:09:16	S	That means together?
00:09:17	T	Try if you reach- yes, yes together. Here you write the calculations you've done,
00:09:21	T	drawing the straw and then try to do the calculations from the other boxes too,
00:09:27	T	those that aren't yours. So in a few words, with the straw inserted like this,
00:09:32	T	in reality it isn't of any use that the box is high, it could also be a box that's very flat.
00:09:41	SN	Yes, good.
00:09:42	T	It's already very flat, yours is really.
00:09:43	S	Yes.
00:09:45	T	But in reality you won't use the fact that- that it's high. Try to think about if you utilize the fact that this one is high.
00:09:51	S	You can do it like this.
00:09:52	SN	Place it like this. Raise it, raise it.
00:09:56	S	Like this, yes.
00:09:57	SN	No. It's not like that, perhaps here.
00:09:58	SN	(inaudible)
00:10:00	SN	Like this.
00:10:01	T	So from you we won't make up for a lot, but in fact...
00:10:06	T	This distance here.
00:10:06	SN	(inaudible)
00:10:07	SN	How do you do it? With the height?
00:10:10	T	Eh, calculate now think- le- leave this like it is. Try to
00:10:15	T	do the other. Now you may have to replace it. Try now to cut
00:10:19	T	the right one here again. Like you said (inaudible).
00:10:22	SN	(inaudible) like this.
00:10:22	T	Try to cut it.
00:10:24	SN	Be careful.
00:10:34	T	It's a little bit too much. You have to cut a bit more.
00:10:41	T	Yes, without forcing it.
00:10:43	SN	Eh, (inaudible) like this (inaudible).
00:10:47	T	Now how can I calculate the length of this straw?
00:10:53	S	No, you do it, here.
00:10:54	T	So, do you have the instructions of the box. Where are the instructions?
00:10:57	S	Here.
00:10:57	T	Then you know how long it is, how wide it is, how high it is.
00:11:00	S	(inaudible) we find.
00:11:02	T	Now reason within the group, explain it to them.
00:11:08	SN	Madam, in what sense are these calculations-
00:11:10	T	Have you found the longest straw?
00:11:11	S	Yes, yes.
00:11:12	T	So then, how is it?
00:11:13	S	Like this.
00:11:14	T	Without bending it, eh, you can't bend the straw.
00:11:18	S	We did it that way.
00:11:19	T	No, no, no, without bending it, eh, without bending it...
00:11:22	S	Aha.
00:11:25	T	You haven't found it yet, try to thin- try to place the straw into it without bending it, eh?
00:11:35	SN	No. First (inaudible).
00:11:36	SN	Once (inaudible) and once here (inaudible).
00:11:39	SN	Why?
00:11:40	SN	Because it's written here.
00:11:43	T	So I- have you found the straw? What is the position?
00:11:46	S	Like this.
00:11:46	T	This one. Now are you calculating its length?
00:11:49	S	Yes.
00:11:50	T	How do you do it?
00:11:52	S	We measure.
00:11:54	T	Okay, measure, that was the first operation. Now you have to calculate the length of the straw.
00:12:03	S	With the Pythagorean theorem you can calculate (inaudible).
00:12:06	SN	And because we placed it oblique-
00:12:08	T	But try to cut the straw corresponding to the diagonal and insert
00:12:12	T	the straw corresponding to the diagonal.
00:12:18	SN	Yes, but-
00:12:18	SN	It's from there to there to here.
00:12:22	SN	No, wait, wait, wait.
00:12:34	SN	Like this we see (inaudible). Let it go. Good, cut it down here. No (inaudible).
00:12:47	T	Okay. This is the diagonal, more or less. Also if no- now however you, with Pythagoras-
00:12:52	T	I can calculate this, okay, with this and this, you have also the measures.
00:12:56	T	But now I'm interested in this. But it- I know-
00:13:00	S	Ah, but now if I have this and this- if I have this and this I'll find it.
00:13:00	SN	I- I, I know that you need to do the- the- the- the- the-
00:13:07	S	But no, but because this one here is practically the diagonal, if you do her above (inaudible), that's it.
00:13:13	SN	No, it's right...
00:13:13	T	Listen to Boris and then try to observe this sheet and complete it.
00:13:19	S	Okay, listen (inaudible).
00:13:24	SN	Eh, the diagonal here (inaudible).
00:13:28	T	M-hm, yes.
00:13:28	S	Right?
00:13:29	T	Yes.
00:13:47	T	We try to be as exact as possible and not lose the precision in our calculations.
00:13:59	T	Or as we said: Instead of writing this, I can write-
00:14:03	SN	This.
00:14:04	T	Directly. M-hm, yes.
00:14:09	T	You can also write here afterwards.
00:14:22	T	But now try- you are calculating other boxes.
00:14:25	SN	Yes, but-
00:14:25	T	You are already at the second one. After some time it seems to be the same thing.
00:14:27	S	Only that (inaudible).
00:14:29	T	Look a bit at the measurements. Look here, they have the same length...
00:14:36	T	The width, instead look at number zero, pay attention to number one.
00:14:42	T	It's quite a lot wider, eh.
00:14:44	SN	But indeed it's right?
00:14:46	T	And then there's the- and then there is the-
00:14:47	S	Ah, already, because it's longer.
00:14:49	T	Afterwards there is the height, which is different, but the- afterwards we will see that it's right.
00:14:50	S	But it's right indeed.
00:14:53	T	Now try a bit- you already did two calculations- try to see if there is a faster way to calculate. It's correct, eh, what you
00:15:00	T	are calculating, but I'd like to see if you can shorten the calculation- also write the unit, eh.
00:15:07	SN	Madam, we have found it.
00:15:09	T	Found?
00:15:09	S	Well we used- we have the Pythagorean theorem (inaudible).
00:15:13	T	M-hm, yes.
00:15:13	S	(inaudible) that we know (inaudible) and now we got (inaudible).
00:15:23	T	Reason. If you cut that right one, go on- this one you can leave down like this.
00:15:30	T	If you cut this one it's too short. You should have found- well, I won't tell you.
00:15:37	T	I don't know if everybody failed, it doesn't matter, we will correct it later. So complete
00:15:42	T	the sheets, this part here and- and it tells you what to do with your box. Then here,
00:15:49	T	there are the dimensions of the other boxes, from the other groups. Try afterwards to
00:15:54	T	calculate those too: the diagonals that you got from the other groups.
00:15:58	SN	Because here (inaudible).
00:16:00	T	The? How do you complete the title? What is it that you apply?
00:16:02	SN	(inaudible)
00:16:05	T	By doing these calculations, what did you apply?
00:16:07	SN	The Pythagorean theorem.
00:16:08	T	Pythagorean theorem, eh. Pythagorean theorem in solid geometry.
00:16:22	T	So now complete your solution in your exercise book: The calculations in blue, the solutions in red in the middle.
00:16:30	SN	(inaudible)
00:16:31	T	Yes.
00:16:31	SN	Will you write it, or shall I write it?
00:16:31	SN	Madam.
00:16:32	T	In your exercise book, eh.
00:16:35	S	Do we have to fill in all of them?
00:16:38	T	Start filling in your part. When you have finished yours, continue filling in from the other groups too, yes.
00:16:44	S	(inaudible) in scribble or do we have (inaudible)?
00:16:47	T	No, no, there is space here.
00:16:52	T	Now. You are at a good point, you only have to check if it's correct. Complete this
00:17:00	T	and draw and do your calculations which Andrea has now written here. Everybody write it on their own sheet.
00:17:06	T	And then there you have the dimensions of the other boxes. There is the box zero, the bo- and start doing the calculations like this
00:17:11	T	for the others, seeing what the others found with their boxes.
00:17:18	SN	We are inexact.
00:17:19	T	You are inexact, what do you mean?
00:17:20	SN	Well, we have practically found that the longest straw is this-
00:17:22	SN	The diagonal from here to here.
00:17:26	SN	Yes.
00:17:27	SN	We found it with the diagonal.
00:17:31	SN	From here to here.
00:17:32	SN	From here to here.
00:17:32	SN	Mine worked, but the straw is this other one.
00:17:34	SN	It's logical because if you put it from here to here it will get longer.
00:17:39	T	That means that you haven't finished calculating yet. It means that what you calculated isn't the length of the straw.
00:17:44	SN	So we, what...
00:17:45	T	But it's only the diagonal from the box- from- from the circumference of the base from the box, from the rectangle, let's say the base.
00:17:53	S	We have to find from here to here, many (inaudible).
00:17:55	T	M-hm, yes... Use this- the measure you have already found.
00:18:01	SN	Thirty-nine point three.
00:18:07	T	You can write it with a pen because I think you did it right.
00:18:14	T	Do it like this, maybe: Cut the straw that you measured, the one placed on the base. Cut it. That way you can observe it.
00:18:21	T	So now, is this one here the right one?
00:18:23	SS	Yes.
00:18:23	T	Also cut the one placed on the base.
00:18:26	SN	Ah, that way?
00:18:27	SN	That way?
00:18:28	T	Yes, with the- but don't- the straw after, no- yes, m-hm, yes.
00:18:29	SN	Cut.
00:18:31	SN	This.
00:18:32	SN	Ah, that.
00:18:42	T	Place it on the base. Eh, cut it again a bit more, that...
00:18:57	T	Ah, still too long.
00:19:04	T	Okay. It's good, it's good. Now place the other. It gets placed in the same...
00:19:11	SN	Like this? In the same trajectory.
00:19:12	T	In the same posit- eh.
00:19:17	T	Now here you have already calculated?
00:19:20	SN	This? We calculated this.
00:19:23	T	You calculated this. Now observe how to calculate the other.
00:19:27	SN	Using the Pythagorean theorem.
00:19:28	SN	Using the Pythagorean theorem.
00:19:32	SN	So it's thirty-nine point six squared.
00:19:34	SN	Minus.
00:19:35	SN	Plus.
00:19:36	SN	Minus.
00:19:37	SN	Plus.
00:19:37	SN	You have to find the hypotenuse.
00:19:39	S	Plus twelve (inaudible).
00:19:41	SN	(inaudible) this one (inaudible) here.
00:19:43	SN	And then you have to do this plus this (inaudible).
00:19:43	SN	(inaudible)
00:19:45	S	Ah, it's true (inaudible).
00:19:48	T	Your calculations, write them here so that you have more space. Afterwards you can also solve them underneath it.
00:19:54	SN	Ah, but (inaudible)?
00:19:55	T	No.
00:19:56	SN	But here, eh, here.
00:19:57	SN	But it's right (inaudible).
00:19:57	T	No, it's okay. Afterwards write it also here, but start- afterwards write it again.
00:19:59	SN	Madam, but here (inaudible) do we have to write the same things like here?
00:20:02	T	Yes.
00:20:06	T	Done?
00:20:07	SN	Yes.
00:20:16	SN	Madam.
00:20:24	T	Have you completed the transparency?
00:20:25	SN	Yes. We didn't get as far as finding what (inaudible) fast (inaudible) the fast calculations.
00:20:31	T	It isn't because you're slow, but you can do it with a single calculation, eh.
00:20:34	SN	Even faster?
00:20:36	S	Madam, it's true that here (inaudible) the Pythagorean theorem (inaudible)?
00:20:40	T	Yes. Think about it for a moment. You square it plus square this.
00:20:45	S	Yes.
00:20:46	T	And find a result. Then take this, and form the other. Didn't I tell you to do it like this yesterday? Isn't it like I told you yesterday?
00:20:52	SN	Ah, right.
00:20:53	S	To already use the (inaudible).
00:20:54	T	Eh- I'll take that. I and then- in reality instead of writing this.
00:21:04	S	Eh, but why we (inaudible).
00:21:04	SN	We have to take the square root of this.
00:21:07	T	Try to think about what I have to write.
00:21:08	SN	Madam, do we now have to check the boxes with the others?
00:21:11	T	Wait, eh. Tell me.
00:21:13	SN	We have found it.
00:21:14	T	You have found it. Then put- take these papers. Now write, well, everybody calculate your calculations.
00:21:24	T	In this area here. Write your calculations, draw the straw, read what's written and start doing this-
00:21:32	T	Tell me.
00:21:32	SN	I've been thinking.
00:21:34	T	Have you finished, have you completed- here you write me- here you haven't completed yet, eh?
00:21:39	S	Ah- do we also have to do this too?
00:21:40	T	M-hm, yes.
00:21:48	SN	Here.
00:21:50	T	Afterwards yes. Number three you can- you only have to fill in the same thing.
00:21:55	SN	Madam (inaudible).
00:21:56	T	Yes.
00:21:57	SN	All the calculations?
00:21:57	T	M-hm, yes.
00:22:12	SN	Madam, by doing the question we got a result that doesn't (inaudible). Why?
00:22:18	T	Well, I think there will be something wrong.
00:22:26	SN	We're done.
00:22:27	T	You're done. Then now complete in your exercise book where there is- what do you have? Box number? Two?
00:22:35	T	Complete case number two with your solution.
00:22:39	SN	Yes.
00:22:41	T	Shall I leave it here?
00:22:43	S	Yes.
00:22:48	SN	But here you can directly-
00:23:30	T	Will you complete the title? What did you apply to find these measurements?
00:23:36	SN	The Pythagorean theorem.
00:23:37	T	M-hm, yes, then the Pythagorean theorem in solid geometry.
00:23:43	T	Sit down correctly, please.
00:23:54	T	And here write down the calculations of your box too, eh.
00:23:57	SN	I've written it here.
00:23:58	T	Never mind, you can transfer it- the idea was writing it above and transferring it down here...
00:24:09	T	Here, label it I. Maybe their- in the drawing- draw it. The I- Your I is only this one, isn't it?
00:24:15	SN	The hypotenuse, which (inaudible).
00:24:16	T	It's the hypotenuse. Draw it in and write the I.
00:24:22	S	No, but then you won't understand well if I write.
00:24:24	T	No, do it in colors.
00:24:26	S	Eh, yes.
00:24:27	T	No, here afterwards, give it another name, also if there- this is also a hypotenuse. Call it straw or call it...
00:24:31	SN	Is diagonal of the base, okay?
00:24:32	T	Or the diagonal of the base, that's the same, yes.
00:24:41	T	Ready, Lucia?
00:24:43	SN	Yes, yes, yes.
00:24:43	T	Do you still need the box?
00:24:45	S	No.
00:24:46	T	So box, tape measure, instructions and scissors. Bring everything to the table, then try to complete the rest of the table
00:24:53	T	with the measurements from your partners.
00:25:03	T	Have you finished yours, eh?
00:25:05	SN	Yes.
00:25:06	T	So in the transparency you have the box number zero.
00:25:10	SN	Madam, do we have to color them? All of the (inaudible).
00:25:14	T	Yes, yes.
00:25:15	SN	Madam, but (inaudible).
00:25:17	T	What (inaudible)?
00:25:18	S	If we've made mistakes with the calculations?
00:25:20	T	I don't know if it's wrong. [Laughter] Complete it and then we'll correct them. Complete it here with your calculations.
00:25:26	SN	Here?
00:25:27	T	There: In your exercise book, in zero. Then if you don't need it any more, bring you box, scissors, tape measure to the table.
00:25:37	SN	Look how easy it is: Only changing all the measurements.
00:25:41	T	Also the straws are to be brought here, eh, not to be played with.
00:25:54	SN	Madam. Here I have this (inaudible) has this.
00:25:59	T	M-hm, yes. It's okay.
00:26:15	T	Try to think a little bit while calculating. That means every time you square a measurement, add the square of the other, then the
00:26:23	T	square root. Then you take this number here, it- square it again and add the third dimension in the square.
00:26:33	T	Think a bit now if this result that I have here, I square it, if I can't instead of taking, he...
00:26:41	T	That (inaudible).
00:26:42	T	Take the first calculation.
00:26:44	SN	Eh, but... (inaudible).
00:26:48	T	Now yes, but if you have finished bring me the material over there, straws a- and stuff like this, and do the measurements of the others.
00:26:56	T	If you have already filled in the transparency- no, I'll bring it to you now, eh, to fill in.
00:27:00	SN	You need to (inaudible).
00:27:02	T	Now you do the same calculations with the other boxes.
00:27:05	SN	We take (inaudible).
00:27:06	T	No, don't take- look, as many measurements are written here, the reasoning is always the same.
00:27:10	T	Bring the material over there, now I'll give you the transparency to complete.
00:27:30	SN	Do we have to do it in red?
00:27:31	T	No, in blue.
00:27:35	SN	No, not this. It's this.
00:27:39	SN	Yes, (already).
00:27:40	SN	And now how should I do?
00:27:42	T	Doesn't matter, doesn't matter.
00:27:46	T	Thanks.
00:27:49	T	And then, Isabella, put the box in its place, eh. Wait, I'm coming. Eh- you, complete in your exercise book
00:27:59	T	(inaudible) the calculations (inaudible) similar...
00:28:02	T	Tell me.
00:28:02	SN	Is it right like this?
00:28:03	T	Try to do it with your own and look: If you find the same result, it's right. If you don't find the same result, that means
00:28:09	T	it's wrong.
00:28:14	T	Have you done yours?
00:28:15	SS	Yes.
00:28:21	T	But it gives you a straw of 880 centimeters?
00:28:24	S	Eh, yes.
00:28:25	T	But was it that long? Was- which one was it? This here?
00:28:29	SN	Yes.
00:28:30	SN	No.
00:28:30	SN	No, this.
00:28:32	SN	Here inside.
00:28:36	T	This one here? But take it out.
00:28:40	T	But also if you take it out a bit, this one here is 880 centimeters?
00:28:44	T	There's something that doesn't work.
00:28:47	SN	We can try to do the calculations again. Try to do this piece here. It equals 48.
00:28:51	T	But take care that- Let's look at your- what did you do before, explain it to me in words. Marisa, what did you do?
00:28:58	SN	Okay, thirty-eight point five squared plus 25 squared (inaudible) to find this diagonal here.
00:29:04	T	M-hm, yes.
00:29:07	SN	Now it's more.
00:29:10	T	But what did Pythagoras say? Having a rectangular triangle?
00:29:18	SN	Right angle side, right angle side (inaudible).
00:29:24	T	Eh- in that triangle which is the right angle side? Which is the hypotenuse?
00:29:27	S	The hypotenuse is this one.
00:29:28	T	Eh, yes.
00:29:29	SN	And these are the other two sides.
00:29:31	T	But this triangle here.
00:29:32	SN	No. This is a side and this is the other.
00:29:35	T	This is a side, that is a side, and this is the hypotenuse. So if you have found this, you already have calculated it.
00:29:42	S	Yes.
00:29:42	T	It's 55.
00:29:44	SN	Squared plus (inaudible) 16 squared and then extracting the root of everything.
00:29:51	T	Do you agree?
00:29:51	SN	M-hm, yes.
00:29:52	SN	We have found it.
00:29:53	SN	Is it right like this?
00:29:57	SN	I get an expression.
00:29:59	T	And where can I simplify again?
00:30:01	S	No. [Laughter]
00:30:02	T	[Laughter]
00:30:04	T	Is it right or can you simplify something else? Are you done with the transparency?
00:30:09	SN	Yes.
00:30:11	T	This goes ahead, two remains. Have you already completed the transparency?
00:30:17	SN	(inaudible), ah, no, the transparency not yet.
00:30:18	T	The transparency. You have to complete with- are you doing number three or number four?
00:30:21	SS	Three.
00:30:22	T	Three. Complete it with your solution. If you have finished with the box, put it back over there, box, scissors. What?
00:30:30	SN	(inaudible)
00:30:31	T	No, put it over there- put it over there.
00:31:24	T	Found?
00:31:25	SN	Eh, yes, I think so.
00:31:27	T	And some of you bring back the box, please. In the meanwhile, Andrea-
00:31:31	SN	Madam, may I ask you (inaudible).
00:31:33	T	In the meanwhile put them away. Later I'll give them to you. Go on, put it inside, Claudio (inaudible).
00:31:47	SN	Wait.
00:31:52	SN	Assio, it's your pen.
00:31:53	T	No, mine.
00:31:55	S	No, why (inaudible).
00:32:05	T	Finished? Now try to think a while, to see if you can find a faster way to do- to find
00:32:15	T	the same result. Instead of doing two calculations every time, do one calculation only.
00:32:23	SN	(inaudible)
00:32:24	T	What do I do? Sqaure this plus fourteen point seven squared, root.
00:32:31	S	Ah- I can use the properties of powers.
00:32:34	T	Be careful, I squar-
00:32:35	SN	Plus, eh, you can't use the properties of powers.
00:32:39	T	Barbara is right. Here is the square root, now the sum, then extract the root, I square.
00:32:48	SN	But first (inaudible).
00:32:50	T	First we extract the root, then we square it.
00:32:54	SN	Ah, so you can take away the root, it's this.
00:32:57	T	Which root can I take away?
00:32:59	S	This.
00:33:00	SN	No. This, because squar- taking away the square root and then squaring it isn't of any use.
00:33:06	SN	But the (inaudible).
00:33:08	T	No, pay attention, eh. Here I extract the root of it all, and then I square it again.
00:33:15	SN	Dividing by two doesn't make sense.
00:33:18	T	Try to write the simplified version. Have you done?
00:33:22	SN	Here we have to do it in the simplified way or-
00:33:24	T	Now what have you found? The measurement corresponds to? Have you measured it?
00:33:26	SN	Yes.
00:33:27	SN	Yes.
00:33:27	T	Okay. So now write here in your- you are the box number four? Write the solution here on the transparency.
00:33:33	T	The result you found.
00:33:35	SN	The same thing that we wrote down here.
00:33:36	T	Yes, exactly.
00:33:36	SN	Now here you extend the same scheme.
00:33:38	T	Yes, and afterwards try to do what the others have done with the other- other boxes.
00:33:43	S	Okay.
00:34:08	T	And pay attention, extract the root but you have to extract what else?
00:34:10	SN	Eh- (inaudible)
00:34:12	SN	I told you.
00:34:13	T	Yes.
00:34:29	T	Why do you take the box?
00:34:30	SN	To do the faster thing.
00:34:32	T	I told you that- however it's enough to look at the calculations, eh, not- the calculations you are doing. Try to reason with some of the numbers you take
00:34:39	T	if you couldn't do it in an easier way.
00:35:08	T	If you would have to write a title. What did you apply in solid geometry?
00:35:13	SN	Boh! I don't know.
00:35:14	SS	The Pythagorean theorem.
00:35:15	T	The Pythagorean theorem. So you can write it... Finished?
00:35:29	SN	(inaudible) square root direct.
00:35:31	SN	And that without- eh- without.
00:35:33	T	The direct square root, what- what is that?
00:35:35	SN	What is the direct square root?
00:35:36	SN	Is the (inaudible) and then you have to square it and immediately extract the root.
00:35:36	SN	This (inaudible) the last time.
00:35:41	SN	Ah-
00:35:42	SN	Do you remember?
00:35:44	T	Eh, yes and no. Yes, it hits a bit. But instead of doing two calculations try to see if you could do it with a single one.
00:35:52	SN	It's enough to do (inaudible).
00:35:53	SN	Put it a bit (inaudible) below.
00:35:54	T	Try to write it.
00:35:59	T	Try to write it.
00:36:00	SN	Let's do it here, go on.
00:36:01	SN	What (inaudible)?
00:36:02	T	What you just told me now.
00:36:04	S	Now here, I'm going to write the same (inaudible)?
00:36:07	T	Yes, now you are doing more then the rest. In the meantime the others, you have to write the same thing here.
00:36:11	T	If not, then- try to do- from now on let's continue all together.
00:36:19	T	Okay, stop, interrupt- shh- [silence] Andrea. Interrupt the things you are doing. All of you have found
00:36:29	T	the length of the straw to be longer then it was in the real box. Now there is- who has already finished calculating?
00:36:36	T	All the others who are still calculating, please go back to your seats now, not in groups anymore, and then look forward.
00:36:47		
00:37:42	T	All right, first of all let's complete the title. Not everybody has done that. What have we applied in solid geometry
00:37:51	T	that we haven't ever done, Neluca?
00:37:52	SN	The Pythagorean theorem.
00:37:54	T	The Pythagorean theorem. So whoever hasn't written it yet can add it.
00:38:11	T	The Pythagorean theorem in solid geometry. Okay, now we will observe the transparency that you have completed.
00:38:20	T	It seems to me that all the groups have understood what the method was, let's say, to apply. Let's start with box number zero,
00:38:29	T	which was the most shallow box. To find the longest straw that was the straw... let's call it diagonal.
00:38:44	T	And now not anymore the diagonal of an area, but the diagonal of the box. I did it like this, first of all I calculated the diagonal
00:38:53	T	of the base's surface and then by using the height I found the diagonal of the box.
00:39:02	T	So all of you- look- looking at the transparency, what do you have? First you calculated the diagonal of a surface and then
00:39:12	T	by taking this diagonal, you have, with the height of the box, you have found the length of the diagonal of the box.
00:39:19	T	All the groups did it this way. For those who have completed the sheets, you can see the various measurements.
00:39:33	T	Everybody used the same method: Always the diagonal of the base and then the diagonal of the box.
00:39:44	T	Now one of you was finished a bit earlier. He tried to find a single calculation to find the length
00:39:54	T	of the diagonal. So that instead of doing one calculation and then doing the second, he has found a single possible calculation to find
00:40:05	T	this length. Now let's take the example- so Barbara and Andrea were able to find it. You had box number?
00:40:11	SN	Eh, one.
00:40:12	SN	One.
00:40:14	T	One or two?
00:40:14	SS	One.
00:40:15	T	Box number one. So their calculation here, first diagonal of the base and then diagonal of the box.
00:40:26	T	Well Barbara, would you like to try to come and explain it at the blackboard? Do it at the blackboard.
00:40:37	SN	Yes. So, first- eh- in practice we put together the two calculations. Do I have to write down the two calculations here?
00:40:45	T	Write it again here? Yes... So, observe the difference between the written calculation on the overhead and the calculation that she is writing now on the blackboard.
00:41:17	S	In practice we put together, eh, the first calculation that- that we have- eh- we have put together the two calculations-
00:41:26	S	eh- but we simplify because in practice the calculation was like this at the beginning. Only extracting the root and then squaring it,
00:41:37	S	isn't of any use. So we simplified, we- we took away the root and we squared it.
00:41:49	T	The result?
00:41:50	S	The result is the same.
00:41:59	T	Good, thanks. Now I don't know if it's clear for everybody, so that instead of writing here- look the second passage of the transparency:
00:42:06	T	On the second passage, what did we write? Twenty-seven point two squared plus nine point five squared.
00:42:14	T	Now instead of writing twenty-seven point two here, they wrote the calculation that allowed me to find twenty-seven
00:42:24	T	point two. Instead of writing the number directly, they wrote the calculation that allowed me to find
00:42:31	T	twenty-seven point two. Then Barbara correctly said: I do the root and then I square it, I can annul it because
00:42:40	T	one is the inverse operation of the other. Therefore the shorter way to find this diagonal is length of the box squared,
00:42:49	T	plus width of the box squared, plus the height of the box squared, and at the end extract the root.
00:43:00	T	They are right, eh, also all of the ways that you all did it. This one here makes it easy to understand the reasoning I used.
00:43:06	T	That I first have to find the diagonal of the base, then the diagonal of the box. You can find this method after doing some
00:43:13	T	calculations. At the beginning it isn't that evident to find this- this calculation.
00:43:18	T	So now, whoever, eh, still has to finish the sheet, complete this sheet with the measurements of the other boxes
00:43:27	T	that your partners had. On the other hand, whoever's finished, I'll give everybody a sheet of exercises. Try to work on them with your partner.
00:43:34	T	I'll leave the solutions here, who- you can come to correct the solutions as usual.
00:43:41	T	But first complete this, without looking, then, eh, check if it's right.
00:44:13	T	Yes, eh... Yes, I'm raising it now.
00:44:16	SN	Thanks.
00:44:16	T	First do it without looking. That means first complete the sheet, then...
00:44:23	T	The overhead projector doesn't work well.
00:44:25	SN	But can we?
00:44:27	T	Have you finished?
00:44:28	SN	Yes.
00:44:29	T	Checked? Are they correct?
00:44:30	S	Yes, yes.
00:45:10	T	Have you understood the shorter version? I saw you looking with the face a bit.
00:45:15	S	(inaudible)
00:45:17	T	M-hm, yes, yes. Now I say if you have understood how you did this, do the others. You can always use this method, can't you?
00:45:23	T	You don't have to do the other, don't (inaudible)- start doing this, afterwards, in case, we'll see next time to- to work on it again.
00:45:29	S	Well I didn't under- well I didn't understa- I didn't understand (inaudible) how to arrange (inaudible).
00:45:33	T	Practically, what did you do here? This number here you transferred here.
00:45:36	S	M-hm, yes.
00:45:39	S	Yes.
00:45:40	T	Do you agree? This number, you transferred here. On the other hand if you have to transfer this number here, I can transfer the
00:45:46	T	calculation that allowed me to find this number.
00:45:50	T	And I used that to find this number here.
00:45:51	S	Yes.
00:45:53	T	Which calculation did I do? I did this, which in reality was this.
00:45:54	S	This.
00:45:56	S	M-hm, yes.
00:45:57	T	Instead of writing this number, I could write this calculation.
00:46:05	S	M-hm, yes.
00:46:05	T	It's the same thing because this calculation gives me the same result. So I can, instead of writing two thousand one hundred fourteen point five-
00:46:10	O	[Bell]
00:46:14	T	I can write this squared plus this squared.
00:46:21	S	And then?
00:46:22	T	(inaudible) plus 166, which would be 13 squared.
00:46:29	S	(inaudible) okay, I'll do it that way (inaudible).
00:46:31	T	M-hm, yes, yes.
00:46:32	SN	Madam, (inaudible).
00:46:37	T	Why?
00:46:37	S	(inaudible)
00:46:47	T	But it's the same as you told me last time (inaudible) is 2,000. Do you remember that you told me already last time that there-
00:46:53	S	Yes.
00:46:54	T	Was this problem with your calculator?
00:46:55	S	(inaudible)
00:47:00	T	Eh...
00:47:02	S	What am I doing wrong? I should extract the root.
00:47:07	SN	Ah, it's true (inaudible).
00:47:09	T	Now you have to extract the root, yes. (inaudible) the result down here, if you extract the root.
00:47:13	S	And the root (inaudible).
00:47:32	T	Did you understand well here? Do it on a sheet by side, on a squared sheet of paper.
00:47:41	T	Vera, got it all right?
00:47:55	T	Boris, got it?
00:47:56	SN	Yes.
00:47:56	T	Cinzia?
00:48:01	T	Is it right now?
00:48:02	SN	Yes. But down here? Yes.
00:48:06	T	Two plus eight, then it depends on how you approximate.
00:48:20	T	When do I have to finish the lesson?
00:48:47	T	Now stop what you are doing, put away everything and we'll continue next time.
