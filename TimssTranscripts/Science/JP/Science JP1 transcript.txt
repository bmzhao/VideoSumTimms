Top of Form00:00:04	SN	Please teach us well.00:00:05	E	Please teach us well.00:00:06	T	Okay.00:00:08	T	Okay then, please take out your handouts that I handed out yesterday.00:00:24	T	Okay then first, look at your neighbor's sheet, and see if they have their results written and check to see if the contents are all the same. Check that over a little bit please.00:00:41	T	Don't worry about the way you express it. Since your expressions will vary from person to person.00:00:51	T	Okay then (someone) will be the representative and check the contents.00:01:03	B	The positive terminal...00:01:08	B	The negative terminal...00:01:17	T	Uh, I had you check the kind of gas that was generated by using things like incense and matches. So I'd like to check the results from that, the name.00:01:32	T	Okay then, the positive terminal, who has the confidence to give me the answer?00:01:36	T	Yes, Yoji-kun.00:01:45	T	Okay please go ahead.00:01:47	SN	(Which one was it?)00:01:48	T	The positive terminal.00:01:49	S	It burned vigorously.00:01:51	T	Yes. And? The name of the gas is?00:01:53	S	Oxygen.00:01:54	T	Oxygen.00:01:55	B	Oxygen00:02:03	T	Okay then, the negative terminal. Who is confident?00:02:10	T	Shohei-kun. You were reviewing over here just a moment ago, right? Okay.00:02:18	SN	Gas?00:02:19	T	Yes.00:02:20	B	Hydrogen00:02:20	S	Hydrogen.00:02:21	T	Hydrogen. Is that okay? Check it over okay? Then the part for examinations and summarizations.00:02:33	T	Uh, when you exposed water to electricity... Daijiro-kun.00:02:40	SN	Oxygen and hydrogen.00:02:41	T	Yes, it separates into to two separate substances of oxygen and hydrogen. Okay, that's the conclusion, right?00:02:55	B	Water --> Hydrogen + Oxygen00:03:16	T	Since you expose it to electricity, you call this type of separation... uh, Chihiro-san. What kind of separation is this called?00:03:28	SN	Electrolysis.00:03:29	T	Yes, electrolysis.00:03:34	B	Electrolysis00:03:46	T	Okay, electrolysis.00:03:48	T	And this is what we did yesterday. So today, what we'll be thinking is water. Being exposed to electricity, it can be separated into hydrogen and oxygen. So what happens in the opposite?00:04:10	T	What I mean is if we have hydrogen and oxygen, is it possible to make water?00:04:19	T	If it was this way. How would it be if the arrow was pointing this way?00:04:24	T	This is what I would like to consider today.00:04:31	T	Okay then, now discuss with your neighbors to see if you think you can make water from hydrogen and oxygen. If you suppose that you can then talk about how you could do it.00:04:47	T	So discuss in depth and think about it please.00:04:50	T	If you suppose that you can't do it, then talk about why you can't do it.00:04:55	T	Okay then, go ahead, discuss it with your neighbors. And I'll have you present your answers later, so have it a little summarized.00:06:18	T	You are always thinking of something so unconventional.00:06:24	T	Looking at your textbooks may- Think of your own answer. I don't want the textbook's answer.00:06:32	SN	Yes.00:06:34	S	What do we do?00:06:39	SN	( ).00:06:41	SN	But this-00:06:45	T	But this... what?00:06:48	S	This is hydrogen //and this is oxygen //so.00:06:49	T	//Yes... //Yes.00:06:50	T	This is the resolution that I just talked about right?00:06:52	SN	That's the resolution.00:06:53	T	You're thinking about the opposite right now, //right?00:06:54	S	//Yes.00:06:55	SN	Oh, the opposite, the //opposite.00:06:56	T	//You've already done this in an experiment so you know you can //do this.00:07:00	S	//I know I can do this but.00:07:02	T	This way okay? The arrow.00:07:03	SN	Make that //the other way.00:07:04	SN	//Okay then, all I need to do is do this to this.00:07:05	T	Yes, so think how you can do that? If it's possible.00:07:09	SN	Teacher forces it together.00:07:11	T	Am I going to force it together?00:07:13	T	Okay then, take out your notebooks.00:07:21	T	Take out your notebooks and first, copy down what I wrote on the blackboard.00:07:28	T	Okay? Below the yellow box it says: "your thoughts" "everyone's thoughts." So as a continuation of that, uh, summarize what you discussed with your neighbors please.00:07:29	B	(in yellow) [Can water be made out of hydrogen and oxygen?]00:07:30	B	(in white) [your own thought, everyone's thought]00:08:20	T	Did you write it?00:08:22	SN	Yes.00:08:23	T	I'm surprised you got this.00:08:26	S	I just wrote it how I saw fit.00:08:28	T	However you saw fit?00:08:40	SN	Huh?00:08:42	T	Hurry up and take out your notebooks and write.00:09:25	SN	Teacher. You see the equipment for the experiment in the front?00:09:29	T	Yes, that?00:09:30	S	Yes, that, rubber, rubber, what was it that we used? A pin, what was it?00:09:35	T	The pinchcock?00:09:36	S	Yes, the connection for the pinchcock. Isn't it possible to take it off once, and then stick a straw in it to connect the rubber part?00:09:42	T	Oh, like this?00:09:43	S	Yes. Can't you do that?00:09:44	T	Well, this side is hydrogen and this side this oxygen. So that means by connecting it you do what to the hydrogen and the oxygen?00:09:49	T	//You put them together. //If you put them together then you think that you can make water.00:09:51	S	You have to put them //together.00:09:53	S	//Mix them, mix them.00:09:55	T	Okay then, that's one thought. Write that down, okay?00:09:57	S	Is that okay?00:09:58	T	That's okay. That's one kind of thought.00:11:06	T	Okay, even if it's just a little bit, write something down okay? And as that thought as the base, we'll expand on it.00:11:39	T	Okay, is there anyone who wants more time? Okay then, a little longer, okay?00:12:04	T	And by the way, since it's rather difficult to just grab oxygen out of the air, we will be using this. Oxygen. It's in here.00:12:15	SN	Give it to me, teacher.00:12:16	T	Okay? It's in here. Now we have it but what should we do with it.00:12:21	S	Teacher, give it to me.00:12:22	T	As for hydrogen, I'm thinking of making it on my own step by step. I'm thinking of making it. So I can prepare the oxygen and the hydrogen.00:12:31	T	Okay, so how will this connect to water after this?00:12:36	SN	Disintegration in mid-air.00:12:37	T	Disintegration in mid-air?00:12:40	SN	Teacher, can I have that?00:12:43	T	There is a limit to our resources. I can't waste anymore.00:12:52	T	What should I do about oxygen.00:12:58	T	Okay then, I'll start asking what you think.00:13:09	T	Yukawa-kun.00:13:10	SN	Huh? Yes.00:13:12	T	Okay, hydrogen and oxygen... what do you do in order to... make water? But first tell us whether you think water can be made or not. Which one do you think is the case?00:13:25	S	You can.00:13:26	T	You can. Okay. What do you think you should do? Uh huh, go ahead.00:13:36	S	Cool it.00:13:37	T	Cool it. Ohh, cool it.00:13:43	B	Possible: Cool it.00:13:54	T	Cool it. Oh, I see.00:13:57	T	Okay then, Sakaki-san. You can or you cannot do.00:14:04	SN	You can.00:14:05	T	You can. Then the method.00:14:08	SN	Warm it up.00:14:10	T	Warm it up. Totally contrastive.00:14:14	B	Warm it up.00:14:15	T	You can do it.00:14:24	T	Hmm, Hikaru-san.00:14:28	T	You can or you cannot.00:14:29	SN	I think you can do it.00:14:30	T	You can do it. What's the method?00:14:32	S	Heat it up.00:14:33	T	Heat it up.00:14:35	B	Heat it up00:14:38	T	Hmm, heat it up.00:14:48	T	Okay then, I think I'll ask one more person.00:14:55	T	Lets see... Yumi-san.00:15:01	T	You can do it. What's the method?00:15:03	SN	Cool it.00:15:04	T	Cool it. The method is to cool it.00:15:07	T	Yumi-san, why did you think of cooling it?00:15:11	S	(inaudible)00:15:23	T	Oh, cool it. Okay then, I'll ask the whole class. Stop what you're doing please.00:15:28	T	Uh, I have hydrogen and oxygen prepared. Now all I have is them prepared.00:15:35	T	So can I or can't I make water from hydrogen and oxygen. Raise your hands. Who thinks it can be made?00:15:45	T	Okay, thank you. Who thinks that it might not be possible? Nobody? You think that it can be done.00:15:55	T	Okay. Actually, there are many ways to make water from hydrogen and oxygen.00:16:05	T	There are many ways. In other words you can do it.00:16:10	T	Yes. It's just that when it comes to the method of how it can be done, well I'm sure that some people have thought of other ways than these to do it but-00:16:17	T	rather than otherwise, this type of answer is the closest.00:16:27	T	I think so.00:16:29	T	Okay so now, you won't know unless you see it with your own eyes, so since there's only one piece of equipment, today we will use this area-//00:16:42	SN	//What about over here?00:16:43	T	I want to make it over there but, for convenience's sake.00:16:46	SN	Teacher what about over here, over here?00:16:47	T	Okay, then will all of you come gather over here please? And will the people already here put your things away.00:16:59	T	Yujiro-kun, this, this, here. Okay.00:17:07	SN	Teacher, aren't you going to mix them?00:17:08	T	Huh? Mix it.00:17:16	T	Excuse me Yoji-kun, will you make some space for me please.00:17:20	T	No, it's a little far. A little. A little more, a little more okay. You know, since I'm so thin.00:17:31	T	Let's see, Kojima-kun sorry, will you turn off the light please.00:17:42	T	Okay, then first, it says to heat it, but if we just take the heating method straight up, then all kinds of difficulties arise. Why do you think that is the case?00:17:57	SN	Does it break?00:17:58	T	Hm? Hikaru-san, why?00:18:03	SN	Something about oxygen and hydrogen blowing up or something on that order.00:18:05	T	Or something that order?00:18:08	S	I don't know.00:18:09	T	Well, hydrogen//is actually-00:18:11	SN	//(inaudible)boom!00:18:13	T	Yes, right. It goes boom, right?00:18:16	T	Will you stick this between there? There, stop fooling around.00:18:21	SN	Ouch!00:18:23	T	Okay, so now in order to be safe//about heating it up, we will be using a machine like //this.00:18:26	S	//Ouch, ouch, ouch!00:18:32	SN	//Put electricity through it... put electricity through it.00:18:35	T	Shh.00:18:36	SS	Shh.00:18:38	T	Pay attention to this part.00:18:40	SN	Hey, it just snapped or something.00:18:43	SN	What are you going to do?00:18:44	SN	That was scary.00:18:46	SN	What would happen if you put your hand in there?00:18:47	T	Hm?00:18:49	S	If you put your hand in there.00:18:50	T	Shh. Can you see? Hiromi-san can you see?00:18:55	T	I'm going to do it again.00:19:01	T	So what this means is as a way of lighting it, lighting a match like this is not the only way of doing it, but using electricity like this is one way of doing it. So we'll be using this to do it.00:19:11	T	So what are we going to use. Something like this, one that's a little bigger than this one. First of all, hydrogen and oxygen must meet inside of here in order to react, right?00:19:25	T	So we are going to have them meet.00:19:26	T	Like Shinya-kun said, we are going to have them meet.00:19:27	SN	We're going to mix them?00:19:29	T	Yes we're going to mix them. And then after that, if you just do this really fast, then the person who lit the match will be in danger, so let's try doing it like this.00:19:41	SN	Ohh.00:19:42	T	Like this.00:19:43	T	Send electricity.00:19:44	SN	Scary.00:19:45	T	Yes it is scary.00:19:46	T	Look in this area, okay.00:19:49	SN	It's going to snap. It's going to start snapping.00:19:54	T	Oh, it's not working. Wait a second, okay?00:19:58	S	I think it's broken, teacher.00:20:01	T	Hmm. Wait a second okay?00:20:05	S	It's not doing it, teacher.00:20:07	T	It's not doing it is it?00:20:08	S	It might not be working.00:20:09	SN	I think you should give//up.00:20:11	SN	//Teacher the small one//.00:20:12	T	It's okay, we don't have to give up.00:20:13	SN	This part is scary//. This part is scary.00:20:14	SN	//Teacher the small one (inaudible).00:20:19	T	Can you tell? Can you tell?00:20:21	SN	Oh, it's doing it a //little, it's doing it a little.00:20:23	SN	//I don't get it because I can't see.00:20:25	T	You don't get it because you have bad sight? Again. I'm going to do it again okay?00:20:28	S	Because I can't see.00:20:31	T	Wait a second okay//?00:20:32	SN	//It's not really doing it right now teacher.00:20:34	T	Wait a second okay?00:20:36	T	There's one more, I'll try using this one.00:20:42	SN	Teacher, this one is not working too well.00:20:44	T	Right? It's not working too well is it? It was working really well. Okay, let's try it with this one. Okay.00:20:55	SN	Teacher, this-00:20:59	T	But you understand the theory behind how this works right? You send electricity and spread sparks through it and... Can you tell?00:21:11	T	Can the area near Hiromi-san see as well? So in this way, you don't actually have to directly do this to oxygen in order to ignite it.00:21:20	T	Okay then I would now like to conduct an actual investigation. Okay then, please get some water.00:21:28	Ss	Taro-chan.00:21:32	T	Okay then from there, from there//get the stand, please.00:21:34	SN	//(That might) hit Aoyama and spill.00:21:35	SN	Taro-chan.00:21:36	SN	Matsushita.00:21:37	T	Okay, sorry. That, that stand.00:21:43	T	Okay, Naoto-kun, will you please get that test tube that's standing up.00:21:49	SN	What about oxygen, teacher?00:21:51	T	Okay, please get the oxygen cylinder.00:22:00	T	Oh, please bring the whole thing. Okay, and then will you get the beaker with the transparent liquid inside of it, please.00:22:12	T	Okay, then we are now actually going to utilize this and-00:22:17	SN	Try doing it.00:22:18	T	Yes, let's try doing it.00:22:22	SN	It's not working too well.00:22:29	T	Please turn off the water.00:22:31	SN	It's cold!00:22:33	SN	Teacher, (where is the) hydrogen?00:22:37	SN	It's kind of scary. It's kind of scary.00:22:39	T	Okay, thank you.00:22:40	SN	Teacher (inaudible).00:22:44	T	Hm? Is this putting it too far inside?00:22:45	SN	Here.00:22:46	T	Wait a second okay?00:22:47	T	It's long so, one more time, excuse me for a second okay?00:22:52	SN	It's cold!00:22:54	SN	Quiet!00:23:03	SN	Teacher, you should take your hands off of it after you put it in.00:23:07	T	Okay, but this one is a little crooked but forgive me okay? Okay, then tighten the screw right there please. A little more, maybe we should raise it a little more. Okay. Something like this.00:23:18	T	Okay, that's good.00:23:21	T	Okay.00:23:29	T	Let's do it a little more like this.00:23:30	T	Okay then, lets first try to generate some hydrogen.00:23:35	S	How?00:23:36	T	How? Put this//, in this.00:23:40	SN	//Don't spill it, okay?00:23:45	T	And then now this. What is this colorless transparent liquid?00:23:51	SN	Ethanol.00:23:55	SN	Sodium chloride.00:23:57	T	Hm? Aoki-san, what could it be?00:24:00	T	Yes, diluted hydrochloric acid. You do this with diluted hydrochloric acid, hydrochloric acid, and then-00:24:06	SN	It's coming out, it's //coming out.00:24:07	T	//It's coming out isn't it.00:24:08	T	However, I won't send the bubbles up the tube immediately. Why is this?00:24:14	SN	The air, the air portion.00:24:17	SN	You have to let the air out.00:24:18	T	That's right. There's some air left over here so in order to make it 100% hydrogen, you must first let the air inside escape.00:24:30	SN	Teacher, it's not going in.00:24:32	T	Oh, sorry. Like this, "pi, pi, pi."00:24:37	S	(Why are you) laughing?00:24:38	T	Like this, "pi, pi, pi."00:24:49	T	We're looking so forward to this.00:24:52	T	Okay, is that good? Okay, that's good. Okay, it's only the first time so this should be fine.00:24:57	T	And I've already put hydrogen in here. Okay then, the next thing will be oxygen. I would like to take the oxygen from this.00:25:15	T	Okay, it went in.00:25:16	SN	You only need that little?00:25:18	T	Okay then, with the method that I used a moment ago, I'll send sparks in here where the hydrogen and oxygen are, and okay, I'm going to start. I'm going to make it react okay?00:25:36	SN	What if it goes baboom!00:25:41	T	Okay then who should I ask to ignite//it.00:25:44	SN	//Me.00:25:45	SN	Someone who's name sounds like ignite.00:25:47	SN	Who's//that going to be?00:25:48	SS	Taro-//chan!00:25:49	SN	Taro-chan!00:25:50	T	Okay then... Taro-chan? Hm, Taro-chan sounds good but I think I'll ask Kitani-kun.00:25:57	SS	Kota? Which one? Kitani Kota?00:25:59	T	Okay, pay attention to this area. Okay, pay attention to this area first okay?00:26:07	T	Okay then Kota-kun, //please put this on the positive side.00:26:10	SN	//You mean Kota-kun right?00:26:14	E	Whooa!00:26:16	SN	Oh, water!00:26:17	T	//Did you see it?00:26:18	SN	//That was too fast man.00:26:19	SN	//Water!00:26:20	SN	Water! //Water!00:26:20	T	//Did you see it?00:26:21	SN	//Say something before you do it!00:26:24	T	Okay, Kota-kun, this was a huge success!00:26:27	SN	Water!00:26:29	T	Hm, huh? What did you notice, Shohei-kun?00:26:33	SN	Boom!00:26:34	T	Boom! And then?00:26:36	S	Oh, it increased!00:26:37	T	What increased?00:26:38	S	Water.00:26:39	T	The water increased.00:26:41	SN	How do you know that it's water?00:26:42	T	Uh, Yuri-san, see anything kind of flash... did you have the time to spare to see?00:26:49	SN	No way.00:26:51	T	You didn't. Okay then we'll try it one more time.00:26:54	SS	What? One more time?00:26:57	T	Well let me tell you, I think you'll be used to it the second time so instead of just going, "Whoa!" watch it okay? Watch it okay?00:27:08	T	Okay then, I'm going to be on stand-by like before for a little okay?00:27:14	T	What? Okay then-00:27:15	SN	Let Kota-kun do it this time.00:27:17	T	This time... I'll have you guys do it from the hydrogen part.00:27:25	SN	Let Kota-kun do it (next).00:27:28	SN	Oh, I got caught.00:27:31	T	Okay then let's have Yukawa-kun put the hydrogen in. The hydrogen producer.00:27:39	SN	Producer.00:27:44	T	Okay, that's fine, okay, okay.00:27:46	T	Okay then, Yukawa-kun, put the hydrogen in please.00:27:51	T	Okay, stand up and do it please. Don't sit down. Do it until about the second hash mark. About here, okay. //Okay, then Yo-kun, Yoji-kun will you watch this here? About two, okay?00:27:57	SN	//This much? This much?00:28:07	T	Okay, go ahead.00:28:13	SN	Not yet?00:28:14	T	Not yet.00:28:19	SN	Impatient.00:28:23	T	Don't get scared. Watch it. Don't close your eyes.00:28:30	SN	Hey Yukawa, you are off line.00:28:33	SN	It's okay, Yukawa, it's okay because it already went to the second hash mark.00:28:35	SN	You scared me. Three more drops.00:28:37	T	A little more.00:28:39	SN	Cold00:28:45	T	Hey, let's not make any ridiculous voices during the experiment, Machida-kun. Let's do this seriously. Do not involve danger.00:28:58	T	A little more.00:29:00	T	Let's increase the quantity just a little more than before. Just a little.00:29:05	SN	How much?00:29:06	T	A little more.00:29:11	T	Okay, that should be fine.00:29:14	T	Okay, then put it back on the test tube holder.00:29:16	T	Okay, then Yoji-kun, do you want to do oxygen? Okay then oxygen. Just add a little, just about one hash mark. Don't put a lot in.00:29:28	T	Okay, go ahead.00:29:32	SN	(inaudible). I can't seem to muster any strength. Wait a minute.00:29:38	SN	It won't come out.00:29:40	SN	It won't come out.00:29:41	SN	It'll come out.00:29:42	T	Shall I do it?00:29:44	T	Try one more time. A little more. Okay, too much got in this time. Okay then.00:29:55	T	The long awaited.00:29:58	T	Uh, for the next igniter-00:30:00	SN	Taro-chan.00:30:01	T	I would like one of the girls to do it.00:30:02	S	Taro, Taro-chan-ko.00:30:02	SN	Why not Taro-chan?00:30:04	SN	Taroko-chan.00:30:16	T	Okay, then, the person who could conduct the yesterday's experiment nicely-00:30:25	SN	Taro-chan.00:30:26	T	Kiyomi-san.00:30:33	T	Let's have you challenge this today as well.00:30:36	T	Okay then it's ready to go. Wait a minute okay? It looks a little irregular.00:30:42	T	Kiyomi-san,over here, come around over here please.00:30:52	T	Okay, it's ready. After you turn it on, all you have to do is turn the lever to plus.00:30:58	T	Okay then, since I was told last time that you didn't have time to get yourselves ready, please tell us that you're going to turn it before you turn it. Okay, please go ahead.00:31:06	SN	Don't say that you're going to turn it after you turn it.00:31:08	SN	I'm going to turn it.00:31:11	SN	Hey, something flew off! Something flew over here!00:31:14	T	Okay, //were you able to notice some kind of change over here this time? What kind of change was it?00:31:15	S	//Hydrochloric acid, hydrochloric acid.00:31:22	SN	Boof.00:31:23	SN	Flash.00:31:24	T	Boof. Flash.00:31:25	SN	It//looked reddish00:31:25	SN	//It felt like my //heart was going to jump out.00:31:25	SN	It //molded it.00:31:25	SN	I couldn't see anything.00:31:26	T	//Huh? Huh?00:31:28	SN	It looked reddish.00:31:28	T	It looked reddish. What about you, Hikaru-san?00:31:33	T	You closed your eyes?00:31:36	T	What about you, Yumiko-san?00:31:38	SN	There was a flash.00:31:39	T	There was a flash.00:31:40	SN	It was distortion.00:31:41	T	What about you, Kaoru-san?00:31:42	SN	Her hair was //shining.00:31:43	T	//It looked like it was shining?00:31:47	T	Okay, then one thing okay?00:31:50	T	When I had Yukawa-kun and Yoji-kun fill this up a while ago with hydrogen and oxygen, the total amount of gas was just below three hash marks.00:32:02	T	Right? Just below three hash marks. It was about here okay? However, with the ignition and explosion, the water... has come up to just above one hash mark.00:32:16	T	So what that means is that due to the ignition, the gas inside this has been-00:32:17	T	Hm... well before you go straight to it becoming water, what happened is that the gas was definitely used, and gone.00:32:22	SN	Became water.00:32:32	T	There's nowhere for it to go right? So the gas was definitely used, and then a reaction occurred.00:32:40	T	Okay then, if water was actually made in here, (and if we were to) investigate. What kind of method would you use to go about investigating that water was actually generated inside of here?00:32:50	SS	Cobalt chloride paper.00:32:53	T	Yes, if you use the cobalt chloride paper, you can confirm the fact that water was made right?00:32:58	T	It's just that it's a little difficult in this case. Since it's all being done inside of water.00:33:04	SS	Drink!00:33:04	SN	Drink.00:33:05	T	Drink? Hmm.00:33:10	T	Okay, I see. Okay, then please return to your seats once.00:33:10	SN	Delicious?00:33:16	SN	Teacher, there's some gas coming out.00:33:18	T	Hm? There was some gas coming out? Okay then, Yujiro-kun, I'm sorry but can you bring this up front? You can take that off. //Over there too. Will you take that too?00:33:26	SN	//Since I am the assistant.00:33:29	S	All of this?00:33:30	T	Yes. Will you bring it over to my desk over there?00:33:35	T	Okay, Ajima-kun, I have to ask you to do something.00:33:36	SN	Yes, what do I do?00:33:37	T	The stand and-00:33:45	S	What do you want me to do?00:33:49	T	Oh, bring it over here.00:33:53	SN	(inaudible).00:33:54	T	Oh, just the way it is. Oh, you can take it off if you want. Can you get it off? Do you know how to take it off?00:34:01	SN	Is this okay?00:34:02	T	Yes that's okay.00:34:03	T	Okay then I would like everybody to... open their textbooks.00:34:14	T	Okay, that's all right. Page 81 in your textbooks.00:34:35	B	[The Process p. 81 Diagram 7]00:34:39	T	Please look at Diagram 7 in your textbook on page 81.00:34:47	T	The equipment that we just used is drawn here, right? It's drawn right? Okay, there are two things that I would like you to add to that. The first thing is-00:35:11	T	There rubber stopper is like this, and this part here is put in like this, right?00:35:24	T	Okay? It's right here. It's emphasized a little here by being drawn large and it's a little separated right? Copper wire.00:35:32	T	So by the copper wire being separated, what did we want to do here?00:35:40	T	You just saw it didn't you? [simulating spark noise]00:35:44	SN	Sparks flew.00:35:45	T	Hm.00:35:46	B	[sparks]00:35:53	T	With the energy from the electricity, we cause sparks and we eventually wanted to produce an ignition, right? So this is purposely cut off and is okay.00:35:56	B	Ignition00:36:05	T	Okay then, please write this down. You may write this in your textbooks.00:36:32	T	Since danger is accompanied by igniting it directly with a match and it's also difficult, yes. But now you can see it in the picture, right?00:36:44	T	That this kind of thing occurred inside of our plastic container. Right?00:36:50	T	So what that means is, okay the second one, is written here, the compound gas of hydrogen and oxygen right? Okay? Will you take your pencil and circle it, please?00:37:03	T	The compound gas of hydrogen and oxygen. We collected hydrogen and oxygen in order to make water right here.00:37:12	T	However, actually, when you ignite it like we just did, it causes an explosive reaction.00:37:18	T	So therefore, this type of gas is called, and with the meaning of it producing a huge reaction in the future in its' name-00:37:31	T	It is called hydrogen detonating gas at times. Write this in your textbooks please. Detonating gas. Like an explosion. Boom. It's telling you that it will cause an explosive response.00:37:52	T	So if you look this word up in some small dictionary, and you look under detonating gas, then you'll find that the explanation is the explosive reaction for hydrogen and oxygen.00:38:05	T	It's written like that so look it up. Yes, detonating gas. It's a word which you are not familiar with, isn't it?00:38:16	SN	Teacher, did you make that yesterday?00:38:19	T	No, last year.00:38:23	S	Teacher, have you used that one many times?00:38:26	T	Because it's about this time of the year.00:38:31	SN	How many times did you use it?00:38:33	T	How many times, which one?00:38:39	T	Okay then write what you learned in your notes.00:38:46	T	What you learned.00:38:58	B	What you learned00:39:07	T	Write it in your notes.00:39:14	T	Just make a list, like the first thing was this, the second thing was this. Something like that is fine.00:39:42	T	Okay then, I think I'll have you come up to the front and write it.00:39:45	T	What you learned.00:39:58	T	Okay then the first person.00:40:04	T	Yujiro-kun. Aoyama Yujiro-kun. Right here... okay.00:40:15	T	The second person... let's see... Kaneda-san.00:40:30	T	The third person... Kambe-kun.00:40:41	T	Okay, when you've summarized it, then come up to the front and write it please.00:40:45	T	You may write it in your own way.00:41:36	T	Yes, it's okay.00:41:45	B	[Water is made.]00:41:50	T	Write down what water is made of.00:42:07	T	Hm? What is it? You can look. You can look as you write it.00:43:15	B	[When you mix hydrogen and oxygen, it explodes]00:43:20	B	[Water was made from oxygen and hydrogen.]00:43:25	T	Okay then, since we've have a few written up here, write your own ideas in your notebooks please.00:43:32	T	Okay then, I've had three representatives write what they thought. Kambe-kun thought that water was made from oxygen and hydrogen. Shoichi-kun.00:43:45	T	Parenthesis two. Uh, Kambe-san right? When you mix hydrogen and oxygen, it explodes. The third one is Yujiro-kun. Water was made from oxygen and hydrogen.00:44:04	T	So how would you summarize what these three had to say in one sentence.00:44:12	T	It was this first theme right here, right?00:44:15	T	Is it possible to make water from hydrogen and oxygen? And since we were able to do that, as a conclusion, we are able to write that type of a breakdown.00:44:24	T	Okay then, will all of you write your own answers, please. Like that. Using signs, like arrows.00:44:34	T	For those of you who don't know, I'll write it up here so please copy it down.00:44:40	B	Hydrogen + Oxygen --> Water (explosive reaction)00:45:19	T	It got a little crooked. Water is created from hydrogen and oxygen. Parenthesis, since I had you write it down, it is explosive. However, it is an explosive reaction.00:46:08	SN	No, teacher.00:46:10	T	Not, "No, teacher." Hurry up and write it.00:46:27	T	What?00:46:29	SN	Teacher, we have parasitic worms in our body, right? What do you call the thing in your intestine that's really long?00:46:37	T	A tapeworm?00:46:38	SN	That's it.00:46:46	T	Don't use an equal sign. Use an arrow. It's a common error but it's not an equal. unlike the mathematical equal, it's not necessarily equal, so yes it's an arrow.00:46:58	T	That was a good place to make a mistake. It's better to make it now. There's a lot of third years who write equal.00:47:08	T	Okay, then this is the last thing.00:47:17	T	Right here, I had you write this last time, but water separates into hydrogen and oxygen. It separates so it is a decomposition.00:47:25	T	Especially since you're sending electricity so we called it electrolysis.00:47:28	T	In the case over here, you are making one thing from something and something, so we call this a chemical combination.00:47:35	T	A chemical combination.00:47:36	B	[A chemical combination]00:47:43	T	A chemical combination.00:47:45	T	So it means that decomposition and chemical combination is the opposite reaction. So from now on we will continue our discussion with this chemical combination.00:48:04	T	Okay then, since we took the time to do the chemical combination, we will go right into a chemical combination experiment in our next class meeting.00:48:12	T	Please look at the same pages 80 and 81 in your textbooks.00:48:25	T	What are you doing?00:48:31	T	What are you doing?00:48:41	T	What we just did was hydrogen and oxygen. It was a gas and a gas to make water, but this time I'd like to try it with a solid matter and a solid matter.00:48:49	T	And what we're going to use is iron.00:48:56	T	And sulfur. You read that as sulfur.00:49:01	T	We are going to mix these two things that, at first glance look nothing alike and... in other words, what I'm saying is let's try a chemical combination of the two.00:49:14	T	Okay then. I talked a little about expressing substances with symbols at the end of the first quarter, and it has been //one month since then, but do you remember it?00:49:30	O	[bell ringing]00:49:39	T	What did, how did we express iron as a symbol?00:49:43	SN	Heat? Heat?00:49:46	SN	Iron00:49:47	SN	Iron?00:49:49	SN	Fe.00:49:50	T	Fe. Okay then what about sulfur?00:49:53	SS	S.00:49:54	T	S. You seem to have a lot of confidence. S. Okay we'll be using these substances. Okay then, it's this handout right? Will the group leader collect them and bring it up to me please.00:50:09	T	We will finish.00:50:10	SN	Stand up.00:50:30	S	Stand up straight.00:50:33	T	Face the front and stand up straight.00:50:35	S	Face the front.00:50:40	S	(inaudible)00:50:44	S	Thank you very much.00:50:45	E	Thank you very much.00:50:55	T	Are the names on there?00:50:57	SN	Yes.00:51:06	T	Hey, why... what were you doing that time?Ê               Bottom of Form
