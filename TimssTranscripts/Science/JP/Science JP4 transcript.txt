That's fine. You can sit down.00:03:47	T	Then lead of a mechanical pencil. These 12 people may be right. Anything else? Do you have experience?00:03:51	SN	No.00:03:52	T	No? Then should we experiment in order? Then first we'll do it with an enamel wire.00:03:56	T	Since it is hard to see my operation, Ms. Yasui will project it on that TV. But come to the front as usual. Please.00:04:17	T	Can people in the front squat down?00:04:22	T	If you cannot see it, you can watch the monitor. Then a little bit-00:04:29	T	Murai-kun, you are the assistant. Please hold this.00:04:35	T	So everyone can see the thermometer. Can you see what the temperature is now?00:04:39	SN	It won't reach all the way.00:04:40	T	Oh, it won't reach?00:04:42	S	This one-00:04:43	T	What is the temperature?00:04:45	SN	Eight.00:04:46	T	Eight degrees, right? Right now it's eight degrees. Then now I will make an electric current flow through this.00:04:50	T	Here, at the tip of the thermometer, I have wound the enamel wire. If it generates heat, the thermometer will indicate it.00:05:01	SN	Ouch, ouch. Ouch.00:05:06	T	Watch this. Oh, it is disconnected.00:05:10	T	Wait. Okay. Watch. It is increasing, right?00:05:14	SN	It is.00:05:15	T	What is the temperature now?00:05:17	SN	Thirty-two.00:05:18	SN	Seventeen.00:05:20	T	It was only eight degrees before, but it's already seventeen degrees.00:05:22	S	It's already about 20.00:05:23	T	It's still rising. Yes. It's almost 20.00:05:25	S	It's rising more and more.00:05:26	SN	I am getting an electric shock.00:05:27	T	I am not getting it at all. See?00:05:30	T	It's already 25. Should I show it to you? Look at the monitor.00:05:35	SN	Where is it?00:05:37	SN	Teacher, where is it?00:05:40	T	Can you see that it has increased?00:05:43	SN	Wow.00:05:44	SN	It's increasing more and more.00:05:45	T	Did it increase?00:05:46	SN	It's increasing.00:05:47	T	This means that?00:05:48	SN	It's increasing.00:05:49	SN	It's increasing.00:05:50	T	It's increasing, right?00:05:51	T	Why don't you do it putting this down?00:05:53	T	It's already 30 degrees.00:05:55	SN	Next, next.00:05:56	SN	It increased so much.00:05:57	T	It increased so much. It was eight degrees, so how many degrees did it increase?00:05:59	SS	Twenty-two.00:06:00	T	Twenty-two. Very well.00:06:02	T	That means that an enamel wire is fine. It generates heat. Then next let's do it with miso soup. Miso soup.00:06:10	SN	Do we do all of this?00:06:12	T	Miso soup is here, here.00:06:15	SN	I don't like it somehow.00:06:16	SN	I don't like it.00:06:17	T	This is a present far you, Matsui-kun.00:06:19	SN	Far you?00:06:20	SS	Far you?00:06:23	SN	She spoke incorrect English.00:06:24	SS	Her English is incorrect.00:06:26	SN	You spoke incorrect English.00:06:27	T	It's okay.00:06:28	OT	She is a science teacher.00:06:29	SN	She spoke incorrect English.00:06:34	T	Then we use this aluminum foil as an electric pole and put this in the beaker.00:06:40	T	You can leave it here.00:06:43	SN	Teacher, aren't you going to give me the one which is in the bag?00:06:46	T	This one, right? I will give it to you, Matsui, so don't worry. Okay?00:06:52	T	I put another electric pole here.00:06:55	SN	(inaudible)00:06:58	SN	There is something in the miso soup.00:07:00	SN	Oh, that's true.00:07:01	SN	Seaweed is in there.00:07:04	T	Don't worry about my cooking.00:07:11	T	Right now... it's five degrees. Five degrees. Five degrees.00:07:18	T	Now I will connect this to the power source.00:07:28	T	Can you see?00:07:29	T	Can you see the inside of the miso soup is moving as soon as the switch was turned on?00:07:37	SS	The temperature is rising. The temperature is rising.00:07:39	T	It's rising, right?00:07:41	SN	It's rising, it's rising.00:07:41	T	//Can you see?00:07:42	SN	//I was right. I was right. I was right. I was right.00:07:44	T	I will put it in the front.00:07:47	T	Can you see? Imai-kun, is it on?00:07:50	SN	Huh?00:07:51	T	Is it on?00:07:54	SN	Something is brewing.00:07:55	T	Is steam generating? It's also bubbling. What is the temperature now? What is the temperature now?00:08:01	SN	Twenty.00:08:03	T	Now 20 degrees. It was five but it went up 15 degrees.00:08:06	SN	Bubbles are oozing.00:08:08	T	Are bubbles oozing?00:08:10	T	Try to touch it. It's warm.00:08:12	SN	Hot. Not hot. It's warm.00:08:14	T	It's warm, right? Touch it.00:08:18	T	It's warm.00:08:21	SN	It doesn't taste good.00:08:22	T	What is the temperature now?00:08:26	SN	Teacher, that's no good.00:08:27	SS	Forty degrees.00:08:28	SN	It's rapidly increasing.00:08:29	SN	It's stinks.00:08:30	T	Is this about right to drink?00:08:33	SN	Fifty degrees.00:08:34	T	Fifty degrees? Then, Masa-kun, it's perfect to drink now.00:08:39	T	This means?00:08:42	SN	Oh.00:08:43	T	Miso soup is also?00:08:44	SN	It's burnt.00:08:46	SN	This bubbles-00:08:47	T	Okay. Then, next, at last, shall we do it with the lead of a mechanical pencil?00:08:53	T	This got very hot. It will break.00:08:55	SN	It will break? Stop it.00:08:58	T	Then next is the lead of a mechanical pencil.00:09:02	T	Then first, since I had some steel wool, I brought it. This one I think everyone can see well. I will do it with the steel wool as well.00:09:19	T	After I set it here.00:09:26	T	That's fine. The connection is not good.00:09:28	SN	Oh, it's burning.00:09:29	SN	Hot, hot, hot!00:09:33	SS	It's burnt out! It's burnt out!00:09:35	SN	Hot, hot! It's burnt out!00:09:37	T	Did you see that it burnt?00:09:40	SN	What is that, teacher?00:09:41	T	This is steel wool. Right now, it's about two volts.00:09:47	SN	Zoom up more.00:09:50	SN	Max.00:09:51	SN	Maximum.00:09:53	T	It's already burning. Steel burns. That means that it generated heat.00:10:00	T	Then, //at last, the mechanical pencil.00:10:03	SN	//In short, you just brought something which generate heat, right?00:10:04	T	Of course.00:10:06	SN	I knew it.00:10:07	SN	There is something which generates heat here.00:10:16	T	Then I will do it with the mechanical pencil.00:10:36	SN	Oh! Acid rain!00:10:38	T	It started smoking. It started smoking, so wait for a while.00:10:48	T	People in the front, be careful. It may jump.00:10:53	SN	I'm fine because I'm wearing glasses.00:10:56	T	Then I will increase the voltage. Right now I am increasing the voltage.00:11:02	T	Something is changing a little.00:11:05	SN	Oh, it became red! It became red!00:11:06	SN	Not a little bit. A lot.00:11:08	SN	If you touch it, you will burn yourself.00:11:10	SN	You won't burn yourself.00:11:12	T	This means that the lead of mechanical pencils also?00:11:14	SN	Conducts heat.00:11:15	T	Yes, it generates heat, right?00:11:17	SN	It conducts heat.00:11:19	T	Rather, it means that it conducts electric current, and generates heat.00:11:23	SN	It's bent.00:11:26	SN	It got thinner.00:11:27	T	When it conducts heat?00:11:28	SN	Can you use the lead?00:11:30	T	It already got so thin.00:11:33	T	Then go back to your seat.00:11:49	T	Almost anything will generate heat when current flows through it.00:11:58	T	That is what I showed you with electric discharge when we studied electric current and electrons. The flow of an electric current means the electrons are flowing.00:12:06	T	Because the electron flow bumps atoms of the material, when they bump with atoms, it generates heat.00:12:17	T	So today, the amount of heat generated, we will measure through an experiment the amount of heat that is generated.00:12:24	T	What is this heat related to? As I just showed you, first, we increased the voltage, right?00:12:34	T	So, it is probably related to the voltage. And if you increase the voltage, logically, what flows a lot?00:12:44	SS	Current.00:12:45	T	Current flows, right?00:12:46	T	So today, we will investigate through an experiment how heat increases in relation to the value derived from voltage times current.00:13:00	T	Then look at the OHP.00:13:03	T	Ms. Yasui is giving you some worksheets like this now.00:13:10	T	Today, you will confirm through an experiment that heat generated by electric current is related to the value of voltage times current.00:13:19	T	I will explain to you how to do it. I think now you got the worksheet, but first set up the equipment like this figure.00:13:31	T	It doesn't show in this figure, but I think it will be good if you prepared a stand like this.00:13:36	T	Then I will explain to you how to set up. First, in order to measure the amount of heat-00:13:44	T	Are you okay? Could you keep looking at this? Watch the OHP. First, set up the thermometer. And hang the thermometer about in the middle of the water.00:13:56	T	And in order to measure the voltage and the current, take a voltmeter and a ammeter.00:14:01	T	The power source to use today is this power source. The container to put it in is this polystyrol container, so it will melt if it touches heat, right?00:14:13	T	So the electric heating wire that generates heat, today we use this but when you put it in, make sure it doesn't touch the bottom or the side.00:14:25	T	It may melt. So you hang a thermometer, but someone should be responsible and hold this heating wire with their hand. It won't hurt you.00:14:34	T	And the water will get warmer by the convection current, stir once in a while and measure the temperature. And-00:14:42	T	Ammeter is in series circuit, voltmeter is in a parallel circuit, the tip is sticking out, so connect the clips here. Two each.00:14:52	T	And, please measure the temperature of the water before you start.00:14:57	T	When you did the survey the last time, I found that you forgot how to calculate heat energy.00:15:02	T	But when you calculate heat energy, the amount of heat that was generated by this electric heating wire is the same as the value which the water receives.00:15:11	T	So in order to calculate heat energy, the mass of water in this container multiplied by the increase in temperature.00:15:22	T	In order for everyone to have the same amount of water, I have measured 100 grams and put in there today. Okay?00:15:29	T	I have prepared 100 grams of water here which has been measured, so please take it from here. The thermometer is also in there.00:15:39	T	And uh... each group read the value of the current with specified voltage.00:15:45	T	And the number of increased temperature will be measured after five minutes. Since we have a limited time, I have a stopwatch and everyone will start at the same time.00:15:57	T	So please tell me when your group finishes setting up the equipment and are ready. When everyone is ready, we will measure five minutes.00:16:03	T	Now, since every group will measure with a specified voltage, can you please write the voltage here? Here.00:16:15	T	First these three rows, no, these three groups. These three groups, please do it with three volts and six volts. So here, write three volts and six volts.00:16:25	T	Then, this row, write three volts and six volts in here.00:16:27	SN	What?00:16:28	T	This row, write three volts and six volts.00:16:31	T	Then these two groups in the middle, write four volts and eight volts. And people over there, please do it with five volts and seven volts.00:16:42	SN	Do we adjust to seven volts?00:16:43	T	Yes. Please adjust seven volts with the voltmeter precisely.00:16:48	SN	Five volts and?00:16:50	T	Five volts and seven volts.00:16:56	T	Then, I will explain to you again. Face this way.00:17:00	T	For example, these groups have three volts and six volts here, right?00:17:05	T	During the experiment, this group will give three volts of voltage at the same time as everyone and measure five minutes.00:17:11	T	Read the ammeter, and see how many amperes it is. And after five minutes, write how much temperature increase there was.00:17:20	T	And this part was to compare the values of voltage times current, so these three volts-And if this is zero point two amperes, for example, three times zero point two and this becomes one point five volt-amperes.00:17:33	T	And as for heat energy, you calculate mass of the water times temperature increase. Okay?00:17:40	T	When you are done, you will have an OHP sheet which Ms. Yasui will give to you. OHP sheets look like this.00:17:48	T	This graph is to record the relationship between the value of voltage times current and the number for increased temperature of the water.00:17:55	T	And as for this one, please record the relation between the value of voltage times current and the amount of heat generated.00:18:01	T	And when you record, just mark dots like this one. This group will have values for three volts and six volts, right?00:18:10	T	This group will have values for four volts and eight volts, right? This group will have values for five volts and seven volts, right?00:18:16	T	When everyone is ready, when we stick these sheets together-The relationship between the value of voltage times current and the number for increased temperature of the water or the amount of heat generated,00:18:27	T	Will appear nicely as dots. So we should be able to infer the relationship between them. Okay? I spoke fast, but did you understand the procedure?00:18:36	T	We will come over when you are not sure. What you have to prepare is the electric heating wire, here. Voltmeter and ammeter.00:18:44	T	Take the power source from there as usual. And each group take two cups, okay? We measure twice, okay? For three volts and six volts.00:18:55	T	So prepare those although we use one of them first. Do you have any questions?00:19:01	SN	No.00:19:02	T	You don't? Then each group, get ready.00:19:09	T	Stands are over there.00:19:26	T	Sorry, sorry.00:19:29	T	I have to put the thermometer for the miso-soup as well.00:19:41	T	You need two cups. One for five volts and another for seven volts.00:19:43	SN	Oh.00:19:44	T	You must change.00:19:47	SN	You told me I have to do well.00:19:49	T	I told you to do well during the experiment.00:19:54	T	Isn't' this (inaudible)? Don't touch it.00:19:59	SN	Teacher, the thermometer too?00:20:00	T	The thermometer too.00:20:02	SN	Do I need (inaudible)?00:20:04	SN	Should I take this?00:20:05	T	Don't drop it.00:20:08	OT	(inaudible).00:20:14	T	Wasn't there enough?00:20:18	OT	How many were there?00:20:19	T	There must have been eight.00:20:25	T	Should I do it with this group? OHP needs to be marked clearly so please write with this. Then first set up.00:20:36	T	When you are done setting up, everyone starts together.00:20:43	T	Isn't it better to hang it in this side? It is unstable.00:20:54	T	Hang it so that it will be in the water.00:21:00	SN	Teacher, this?00:21:01	T	About five minutes.00:21:02	S	The spring-like thing.00:21:03	T	Oh, electric heating wire?00:21:05	T	Huh? There should be eight. Sorry, did anyone take two heating wires? There should have been eight of these.00:21:15	T	Oh, you took too many, okay, okay.00:21:17	T	Here they are.00:21:28	T	Put the thermometer in the cup and set it up.00:21:31	SN	(inaudible)00:21:32	SN	No, from the side.00:21:33	T	Yes, yes. You measure the temperature of the water first. This is unstable, so from this side.00:21:45	T	Since we want to measure the temperature of the water first, please hurry up and set up the water.00:21:55	T	After hanging it, support it with your hand.00:22:03	T	Kawai-san... Here, it's your turn, Masago.00:22:06	SN	You have to hold this one like this.00:22:08	T	Yes. That's why you should hang the thermometer.00:22:14	T	Masago-kun, you turn that so that you can hang the string.00:22:17	SN	Oh.00:22:30	T	Why don't you put it here?00:22:57	T	And set it in a series circuit. Which one is positive?00:23:03	T	This one, right? Yes, yes.00:23:09	T	This one is negative, right? And this one is positive.00:23:13	T	This one, this one.00:23:20	SN	This one may fall off.00:23:21	T	That's fine.00:23:23	T	Yes. Then please wait if you finished setting up.00:23:26	T	If you are behind in setting up, I will help you.00:23:30	SN	Oh!00:23:32	T	Should I help you? Are you finished setting up?00:23:34	SN	Is this okay? (inaudible)00:23:37	T	Oh... milli ampere is hard to see, so leave it as a bigger ampere.This one, you can leave as fifteen volts, since we didn't predict how much current will flow yet.00:23:48	T	Are you done?00:23:51	T	Set the ammeter in a series circuit.00:23:57	T	Plus five amperes, right? And this one? This one is positive, so connect the negative here. And put this one here.00:24:12	T	Are you done?00:24:21	T	Why don't you do it from the side? Like this. This clip is dirty so it may be better to change it.00:24:32	T	This is a clean one.00:24:34	T	Here you are. Please someone hold it. Here you are.00:24:41	T	Then record the original water temperature when you are done setting up.00:24:45	T	Record the original water temperature.00:24:52	T	Are you done setting up? Hurry up and set up, since everyone is waiting for you.00:24:58	SN	How many volts should we have first?00:25:05	SN	Five amperes.00:25:06	T	You have to connect one to the ammeter. Is this positive? Then put this to the positive.00:25:20	T	And this?00:25:26	T	Should we put this to here then?00:25:29	T	Mei, the ammeter is not connected.00:25:35	T	This one goes to positive. This one. This one is positive, Mei. Here. And... Bring this to here. Bring the five-ampere terminal to here. One more, one more.00:25:47	SN	(inaudible)00:25:50	T	Are you done? Yamase-kun's group, are you done? Okay?00:25:54	T	Then we will start five minutes from now. Set the first voltage with the voltmeter.00:26:06	T	Then we will start.00:26:09	SN	First we do it with four volts.00:26:10	T	First, set it to your voltage.00:26:12	T	If you do it with three volts and six volts, start with three volts first. If you do it with four volts and eight volts, start with four volts.00:26:17	T	If you do it with five volts and seven volts, start with five volts.00:26:21	T	You adjust with the voltmeter, you know?00:26:22	SN	It's this one, right?00:26:23	T	Yes. Read with the voltmeter. Not that one. Read it with the voltmeter. Anyone that doesn't understand?00:26:38	T	Ms. Yasui, are we ready?00:26:43	T	Ms. Yasui, are we ready?00:26:48	T	Ready? Then we will do it for five minutes. Okay?00:26:56	T	Yes. Are we ready? Ready? Then ready, go!00:27:03	T	Then, put in the water.00:27:07	OT	Wait, wait.00:27:09	SN	We cannot wait.00:27:11	T	Stir sometimes. Stir sometimes, please.00:27:20	T	Read the voltmeter now.00:27:24	SN	It was hot.00:27:26	T	You are doing it with four volts, right? Does it say four volts?00:27:28	SN	Yes.00:27:29	T	Yes?00:27:30	S	Huh?00:27:31	T	You have to adjust it to four volts.00:27:32	SN	Huh? We adjusted it before, didn't we?00:27:33	T	Did something move?00:27:36	SN	Huh?00:27:37	T	The current is not flowing.00:27:38	SN	Is there some part which is disconnected?00:27:40	SN	Really?00:27:43	T	Let's turn it off once.00:27:45	T	Was it okay before?00:27:47	SN	Yes, it was.00:27:49	T	Did it short circuit?00:28:01	T	Are the positive and the negative okay?00:28:04	T	This is positive, so this is positive. This one is negative. This is correct. Then should we do it again?00:28:12	T	That side-00:28:13	SN	It's not increasing.00:28:14	T	It's not increasing, is it?00:28:15	SN	Why?00:28:23	T	Why is it not increasing?00:28:30	T	A little bit.00:28:32	T	Can I disconnect it once? I will (inaudible).00:28:40	T	Your group was supposed to do it with four volts and eight volts, right? Then you can start next with eight volts.00:28:47	T	It starts from positive and-00:28:53	SN	It starts from negative and-00:28:56	T	This one, right? It goes from positive and here, right?00:28:59	T	And put the positive of the voltmeter here.00:29:07	SN	Teacher, it is not good if this and this are touching, is it?00:29:10	T	Yes, it's better if it's not touching.00:29:12	S	They are touching.00:29:13	T	Then let's try now.00:29:16	T	It's not going up yet?00:29:17	SN	It's not going up.00:29:18	SN	Why is that?00:29:19	T	The voltmeter is working. How about the ammeter? The ammeter is not working either.00:29:33	T	Nothing is wrong with the power source.00:29:39	T	Did it touch the heating wire by mistake?00:29:50	SN	It went up.00:29:51	T	It went up? Then the connection was wrong, since you pulled these so they were not connected well. (Inaudible) Then, it's too bad, but you do it with eight volts.00:30:03	SN	I was worried.00:30:04	SN	Next one, right?00:30:05	T	Yes, you can do the next one.00:30:08	T	You can get the data from the neighboring group.00:30:13	T	Did it work?00:30:14	OT	Voltmeter was working till just now.00:30:17	SN	We have problems.00:30:18	SN	Mr. Cameraman, we have problems.00:30:24	T	Did you connect correctly?00:30:29	SN	Oh, it went up.00:30:31	SN	It went up fine.00:30:33	OT	It went up? Oh it went back?00:30:36	SN	Move this one too.00:30:37	SN	It's too much.00:30:38	T	How many volts are you suppose to have?00:30:39	SN	Five volts.00:30:40	S	Not yet, not yet.00:30:42	SN	Little less, little less. Stop.00:30:43	T	Did it work?00:30:44	S	Yes, it did work.00:30:45	T	Then you start with the next seven volts also.00:30:48	SN	Huh?00:30:49	T	Since these five minutes have already started. Okay?00:30:52	OT	Teacher, was something wrong with that part?00:30:53	T	This part was bent, so I think the connection inside was not good.00:30:54	OT	Oh, I see.00:30:58	T	Don't bend here. If you bend this, Yamase-00:31:01	SN	We didn't do it.00:31:02	T	Really?00:31:03	S	Why me?00:31:04	T	Yes, yes.00:31:07	T	Then, next you can measure the seven volts well, right? Then get the data from your neighboring group.00:31:18	T	Stir it sometimes.00:31:24	T	Thirty seconds more.00:31:28	T	Thirty seconds more.00:31:33	T	That's fine. It's three volts, right? Then zero point six amperes, right?00:31:38	T	Calculate here now. It's three volts times zero point six amperes, so how much?00:31:45	T	You can calculate in your head.00:31:48	SN	One point eight.00:31:49	T	Yes, one point eight... volt-amperes.00:31:56	T	Then... write volt-amperes.00:32:00	O	[timer]00:32:02	T	Now, measure the temperature. How many degrees did it increase from the original temperature?00:32:06	SN	Can you take turns?00:32:12	T	You guys... You (inaudible).00:32:14	SN	Thirty-seven.00:32:16	SN	Thirty-seven?00:32:17	SN	Thirty-seven.00:32:21	T	Then please write how many degrees it has increased.00:32:26	T	Then we will do the next one. Change the cup.00:32:30	SN	Thirty degrees Celsius. Then what about this one?00:32:35	T	Change the cup. We will do it for the next five minutes.00:32:38	SN	Is 30 the number that increased?00:32:39	SN	It increased from seven to 37, right?00:32:44	T	Then your group is doing it with six volts, right? Six volts next, right?00:32:52	T	While the thermometer settles down, you can calculate heat energy. In order to make the thermometer settle down, calculate heat energy.00:32:59	SN	I forgot how to calculate heat energy.00:33:03	OT	Turn off the power source.00:33:09	T	Next you will increase the voltage, so I think it is better to increase the ampere too.00:33:16	T	Wait until the water temperature is settled.00:33:18	T	Water mass was 100 grams.00:33:19	SN	One hundred grams?00:33:20	T	Yes.00:33:22	S	One hundred times the number of temperature increase-00:33:23	SN	Wait a minute. It wasn't 37. It was 47.00:33:25	T	Your group only had a little increase?00:33:27	SN	Yes.00:33:28	T	Well, that's fine. That is your result. How many amperes was the current?00:33:31	SN	Three.00:33:32	SN	Huh?00:33:33	T	How many amperes was the current at that time?00:33:36	SN	It increased around here first. Was it around here? One hundred, around here?00:33:43	T	How many?00:33:45	SN	Uh... zero point five.00:33:49	T	Was it zero point five? Then write here zero point five amperes.00:33:56	T	Then, this was voltage times current, so three times zero point five.00:34:03	SN	Three times zero point five.00:34:13	T	Zero point five is half. So what is half of three volts?00:34:17	SS	One point five.00:34:18	T	One point five, right? One point five.00:34:23	T	Read this, "volt-ampere."00:34:26	SN	Do I write it like this?00:34:28	T	And write a dot here since this is multiplication.00:34:31	T	Then what about the amount of heat generated? It increased two degrees right? Then the water was 100 grams originally, so 100 times increased two degrees-00:34:39	T	How many calories? One hundred times two equals?00:34:43	SN	Two hundred.00:34:43	T	Yes, 200 calories. Do it like that.00:34:51	SN	How do you read current ampere?00:34:53	T	You have to read it as volt-ampere.00:34:55	SN	//Teacher, this is twelve point five-00:34:56	T	//Three times... your current was twelve point five amperes?00:34:59	SN	Yes.00:35:00	SN	Is this 15?00:35:02	T	That's voltmeter. How about the ammeter?00:35:04	SN	Huh? //Isn't this ampere?00:35:06	T	//This was twelve point five amperes?00:35:08	S	It was three.00:35:09	T	Huh?00:35:10	S	Huh?00:35:11	T	This was, right? You wrote twelve point five. Was the current really //twelve point five?00:35:14	S	//No, it was three.00:35:16	SN	Three.00:35:17	T	It was wrong, right?00:35:18	S	No, it wasn't.00:35:19	T	This is a ammeter, so-00:35:20	SN	Ouch.00:35:21	T	Ouch. How much?00:35:23	SN	Ouch.00:35:24	T	It can only measure up to five amperes, so it cannot be possible to measure twelve point five amperes.00:35:27	SN	What we measured was three and six.00:35:29	T	That's voltage. I'm asking about the electric current. Was the current flow twelve point five amperes?00:35:35	SN	Huh?00:35:36	T	The ammeter. //Did twelve point five amperes flow?00:35:38	SN	//She is asking how much current flowed.00:35:43	SN	We adjusted this before, didn't we?00:35:44	SN	Only three amperes flowed.00:35:46	T	No, no. What I am saying is that you adjusted the voltmeter to three volts, right? At that time, //the ammeter-00:35:50	SN	//We didn't.00:35:51	T	What?00:35:53	SN	[laughter]00:35:55	T	What did you adjust to three volts then? This is a ammeter.00:36:03	T	This is the voltmeter.00:36:06	SN	Huh?00:36:12	SN	But nobody noticed.00:36:13	T	Nobody noticed?00:36:16	SN	Teacher (inaudible), didn't she?00:36:18	T	No, I said adjust it with this one.00:36:21	SN	Did she say that?00:36:22	T	This data... I thought the temperature went up too much.00:36:27	SN	Saki-chan.00:36:28	T	Since you cannot use this data, start with six volts.00:36:30	SN	Yes.00:36:32	T	Oh, no.00:36:33	SN	We, we were holding this all the time. We were holding it. And at the certain point-00:36:38	T	This is a ammeter.00:36:40	SN	Do we have to adjust with this one?00:36:41	T	Unless it is voltmeter, you cannot measure voltage.00:36:43	SN	(inaudible)00:36:46	T	Well then, we will start the next experiment.00:36:51	T	Then please read the thermometer.00:36:56	T	Then we will start. Okay? Measure voltage with voltmeter. You cannot measure it with a ammeter. We will start.00:37:10	T	We will start. Ready.00:37:12	SN	Teacher, teacher, wait a second.00:37:14	T	Should I wait a little bit?00:37:15	SN	Four more minutes.00:37:21	SN	This is wet.00:37:22	SN	What are you doing?00:37:23	SN	What are you doing?00:37:24	SN	(inaudible)00:37:25	T	Hold it with your hand, don't be lazy. You are making everyone wait.00:37:31	SN	Hurry, hurry. Put it down, put it down.00:37:32	T	Ready?00:37:35	T	The group over there. Did you read the thermometer?00:37:38	SN	Of course.00:37:39	T	Yoshikawa-kun, did you read the thermometer?00:37:41	SN	We are reading it right now.00:37:43	SN	Can I raise this to here?00:37:45	T	That's fine. Don't worry about it.00:37:51	T	Oh, no. That group is-00:37:53	T	I will start. Ready? Go.00:37:55	SN	Seriously?00:37:56	SN	Ready, go.00:37:57	SN	Voltage should be six, right?00:37:59	SN	Six, six, six.00:38:04	T	This should be eight voltage this time, right?00:38:06	SN	Yes.00:38:07	T	Yes.00:38:08	SN	Bubble is oozing.00:38:09	T	That's fine.00:38:11	S	Is it okay?00:38:12	T	Stir it once in a while.00:38:21	T	Don't make a mistake this time. Oh. Oh.00:38:25	SN	This one is one point five, right?00:38:27	T	Only five amperes, right? Yes.00:38:28	SN	Five amperes?00:38:29	T	Five amperes?00:38:30	SN	Oh.00:38:31	SN	This means it is one point five volts.00:38:33	T	Why did you mix up a voltmeter and a ammeter again? We did it so many times... Oh well.00:38:38	SN	Because the color is blue and green.00:38:40	T	Then multiply this current and this voltage.00:38:43	SN	Five times six equals 30-00:38:45	T	Yes.00:38:47	S	Sixteen, 18-00:38:49	SN	Nine.00:38:50	SN	[laughter]00:38:52	T	Nine, right?00:38:55	SN	(inaudible)00:38:56	T	This time do it well, okay?00:38:59	T	Don't worry, since that group made mistakes, your group's two degrees increase is just about right.00:39:04	SN	(inaudible)00:39:07	SN	Sometimes people make mistakes.00:39:09	T	But I think this is unusual.00:39:19	T	Then while you are waiting for five minutes, put dots for the previous data in the graph on an OHP sheet.00:39:31	T	Should I tell you how to use this?00:39:36	T	In the beginning it was one point eight, right? One point eight, this is two. When it is one point eight, the temperature increase was two. So, here?00:39:46	T	Next, if it generated 200 calories, when it is one point eight, it is 200, so it goes here, right? You just put a dot here with a small circle.00:39:54	T	The next one is the same way. Just put a dot. Okay?00:39:57	SN	Just dots?00:39:58	T	Yes, just putting dots is fine.00:40:00	T	Then watch it carefully so that you won't make a mistake next time. The next data is with nine, right?00:40:04	T	Since you will have only one dot, this is voltage multiplied by current, you will see how many degrees it increased after five minutes.00:40:12	T	At that time, draw a point here. When you calculate heat energy, in the same way, nine, here, right? What is the amount of heat generated when it is nine? Put a dot.00:40:22	SN	How do we calculate heat energy?00:40:23	T	The amount of heat energy is mass of water multiplied by temperature increase.00:40:26	SN	Teacher, when I calculated it with the previous data, it became 3,000.00:40:29	SN	Three thousand.00:40:30	SN	Is the mass of water 100?00:40:31	T	Yes, today it was 100 grams.00:40:34	SN	The number of increased temperature is 30-00:40:36	T	But your group applied a fairly high voltage because in order to ten? three, three amperes.00:40:46	SN	Teacher.00:40:47	T	Yes.00:40:49	T	Oh, this one, right? It became one point five, right? This one goes two, four, six; so one point five is around here, right?00:40:55	T	And then the number of increased temperature is two, right? Around here. So put a dot around here.00:41:02	T	Next is the same way. When it is one point five volt-ampere, it is 200 calories, right?00:41:06	T	Since this side is for heat energy, so when it is one point five, circle at 200 calories. Okay?00:41:17	T	How is it? You have only one datum. Then, first multiply current and voltage, first. Eight times one point three.00:41:28	T	How much is it, Hirai-kun.00:41:30	SN	Ten point four.00:41:31	T	Ten point four. He said ten point four.00:41:33	S	Ten point four.00:41:36	T	Then, you draw the number of the temperature increase after five minutes, right? And for calculating heat energy-00:41:43	T	Since the heat that was given by the electric wire is the same as the heat that was received by the water-00:41:46	T	The mass of the water is 100, right? And multiply the number of the temperature increase and get the amount of heat. Okay?00:41:54	T	And when you write it in here, it is ten point four. This is 10 and 12, right? Find where ten point four is.00:42:01	T	And put the dot in here at the temperature increase.00:42:05	SN	Imai-kun has suspicious eyes.00:42:07	T	In the same way, put a dot to indicate the amount of heat energy when it is ten point five. Did you understand? There is only one datum, so do it precisely.00:42:21	T	Were you explained how to draw the graph? Okay?00:42:26	SN	This is big.00:42:28	T	That's fine. Big is fine.00:42:31	T	Twenty more seconds.00:42:34	T	Get ready to read the thermometer.00:42:36	SN	Well, now it's 16 degrees//00:42:38	SN	//(inaudible) get ready to write//00:42:39	SN	//this is 16.00:42:40	T	Did you put dots?00:42:44	T	Where? Oh, I cannot see it. Draw it clearly.00:42:47	SN	Teacher.00:42:47	T	Yes.00:42:49	T	This one? You got six point five, right? It's six point five, so is it about here?00:42:54	O	[timer]00:42:56	T	Then read the next temperature.00:42:57	SN	It's over.00:43:00	T	It increased four degrees, right? So it's four, yes, yes.00:43:07	SN	We are done.00:43:09	SN	How many degrees have increased?00:43:10	T	You know, right?00:43:11	SN	That's why it's one point six.00:43:13	SN	It's 14, I heard.00:43:16	SN	Fourteen. Thirteen.00:43:20	T	Did it increase 11 degrees?00:43:23	T	This one is the number of increase, so you have to write four for this.00:43:25	SN	Oh, I see.00:43:30	T	Yes, yes. And this... you draw a circle, but this is for calorie.00:43:34	SN	Oh, calorie.00:43:43	T	Then, when you draw on the sheet, bring it to me.00:43:49	SN	It's ten point five. Is it around here?00:43:52	T	Make sure to turn off the power source.00:43:59	T	When you are done with the sheet, bring it to me.00:44:03	OT	Draw it with this pen.00:44:06	SN	Where? Here?00:44:09	OT	Draw it bigger.00:44:20	T	Then next. Next is?00:44:23	SN	The size is different.00:44:26	T	When you finished the sheet, bring it to me.00:44:29	T	Should I make it thicker? Like fat people. It is clearer in this way. These are so reserved. Then I will take this. Thank you.00:44:42	T	When you are done, please bring it to me.00:44:53	T	Are you done? Oh this was yours.00:44:56	T	Bring the sheet quickly please.00:45:01	T	The group who turned in the sheet, please look at the OHP.00:45:12	SN	Is this okay just like this?00:45:13	T	That's fine. We will stick them.00:45:33	T	Did everyone turn it in?00:45:35	OT	Six point five and 400 degrees.00:45:41	T	The group who turned it in, please watch this.00:45:44	OT	Around here.00:45:46	T	Thank you for bringing it to me.00:45:47	OT	Then... eleven point two and eight degrees. Eleven point two is eight degrees.00:45:53	SN	Eleven point two.00:45:55	OT	Then eight degrees.00:45:58	T	One more group?00:46:07	SN	Kaji-kun, please take it.00:46:13	T	Thank you.00:46:21	T	Then, let's take a look.00:46:26	T	I stuck all of them together. Then the result of your measurement became like this. So should I draw a line?00:46:37	T	May I borrow your ruler?00:46:42	T	Thanks.00:46:44	T	This... when the voltage and the current are both zero, there is neither temperature nor heat energy. Here. Origin, okay?00:46:55	T	Then I will draw a line so that it is close to all the dots.00:47:08	SN	Oh! Amazing! They are exactly on the line!00:47:10	T	Yes, some are exactly on the line.00:47:11	S	See?00:47:12	T	That means-00:47:16	T	What can we say from this?00:47:18	SN	This is amazing.00:47:23	T	Voltage times current equals... what kind of relationship is there in relation to temperature increase and heat energy?00:47:40	SN	Proportion.00:47:41	SN	Proportion.00:47:42	SN	Proportion.00:47:46	T	What is it? One more time?00:47:48	SS	Proportion.00:47:49	T	It has a proportional relationship, right?00:47:56	T	Okay?00:47:58	T	We found that heat energy is proportional to the product of voltage and current.00:48:05	T	Then using this result, please try to solve this question.00:48:10	T	Okay? Heat energy is proportional to the product of voltage and current.00:48:18	T	Then, this question.00:48:23	T	This one is a parallel circuit combining a big resistance and a small resistance. This one is a series circuit combining a big resistance and a small resistance.00:48:38	T	Then in this parallel circuit, which one produces more heat? This one or this one? In a series circuit, which one produces more heat? This one or this one?00:48:50	T	Think hard. Heat energy is proportional to the product of voltage and current.00:48:58	T	I will ask each group, so make a prediction for this first.00:49:18	T	First with the parallel circuit.00:49:21	SN	What should we do?00:49:22	SN	I don't know either.00:49:24	T	You have to listen carefully.00:49:26	T	In that parallel circuit-00:49:27	SN	Yes.00:49:28	T	The big resistance and the small resistance-00:49:30	S	Yes.00:49:31	T	Which one produces more heat?00:49:32	S	Yes.00:49:33	T	Then, I will call your name next, Yamase-kun.00:49:36	S	The small one, isn't it?00:49:46	T	Then stop. Class will be over soon, so I will ask you now.00:49:50	T	This one. Is there any group who has thought about this? Which one is larger?00:49:53	SN	Yes.00:49:54	T	Then, Yoshikawa-kun's group.00:49:58	T	You answered. Yoshikawa-kun.00:50:02	T	Which one produces more heat?00:50:05	SN	The one which has smaller resistance.00:50:06	SN	Yes, yes. Same answer.00:50:08	O	[bell]00:50:09	T	Then Matsui-kun.00:50:10	SN	One with the smaller resistance.00:50:11	T	One with the smaller resistance. How about the other group?00:50:16	T	Then Yoshikawa-kun, why does this one produce more heat?00:50:23	T	Huh? Then Matsui-kun. Why does this one produce more heat? Huh? Oh, this gesture indicates that the girls thought this out. Then I'll ask the girls. Then Kimo-san.00:50:37	SN	Because the smaller the resistance is, the more current flows.00:50:40	T	The more current flows, right?00:50:44	T	Okay? In a parallel circuit, voltage is... the same everywhere. If that is the case, the more current flows, the greater the heat that is generated, right?00:50:58	T	So this one produces more heat. Then how about the series circuit? We don't have time, so I will ask you. Who thinks this one produces more heat?00:51:13	T	Then who thinks this one produces more heat?00:51:17	T	Some people are undecided. Then I will ask you in the next class, but I will give you a hint.00:51:23	T	In a parallel circuit, the voltage was the same, but what was the same in a series circuit?00:51:33	SN	Current.00:51:34	T	Yes. The current is the same. Think about this question, this hint in your mind.00:51:40	T	What does this mean? Then we will finish. Matsui-kun.00:51:45	SN	Stand up.00:51:53	T	Then clean up after we greet.00:52:01	S	Straight.00:52:05	T	Yoshi-kun, you have to clean up, too.00:52:09	S	Bow.00:52:10	E	Thank you very much.00:52:11	T	Thank you very much.00:52:27	T	Yamase-kun, Yamase-kun, come here.00:52:38	T	Oh, wait a minute. Stay seated for a little bit. There will be a survey, so please sit.Ê               Bottom of Form
