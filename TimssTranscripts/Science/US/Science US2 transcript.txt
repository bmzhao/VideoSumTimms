00:00:51	T	Good Morning! Fine, how are you?00:00:58	T	Sorry.00:01:07	T	Go away, Jeffrey.00:01:37	T	Yes, I think that would be a wise idea. Okay.00:03:16	T	Ah, ladies and gents my suggestion is to when you're working on your journal entry,00:03:20	T	if I were you I'd kinda go over your notes a little bit, too. Okay? Jason?00:03:25	SN	I was absent Tuesday, so I need to make what I need to make up.00:03:28	T	Okay, well then you need to go and get the notes from somebody in class, okay?00:03:33	T	Because we had a minimum day that day so we took notes, and played around with two polymers.00:03:40	T	And I'm gonna see whether or not you guys can remember that.00:04:37	B	[What I know about polymers. . .]00:04:47	T	(inaudible) have something (inaudible)? No, those are your notes, right?00:04:50	SN	Those are hers.00:04:51	T	Oh, those are hers, //(inaudible) lesson?00:04:52	S	//I was- //No, I (inaudible).00:04:53	T	//That's right, you (inaudible) studying. Okay.00:04:59	T	And who did you borrow those from, Ginger?00:05:01	SN	(inaudible)00:05:02	T	Okay.00:05:17	T	Two things about polymers. Do you remember?00:05:20	SN	Yeah.00:05:21	T	Okay.00:05:26	T	Okay guys, about 30 seconds to finish your thoughts.00:05:50	T	Okay, ladies and gents somebody in here raise your hand and tell me something that you've learned about polymers.00:05:57	T	Something that you know about polymers, based on last class period. Something that you know about polymers. Jim?00:06:05	SN	Yeah, that uh manmade polymers are stronger than natural ones?00:06:09	T	Could be. So, um, you learned about manmade versus natural polymers?00:06:16	S	Yeah.00:06:22	T	So they come in two kinds, manmade and natural. Somebody else? Charlotte?00:06:25	SN	Doesn't poly mean many, many?00:06:28	T	Poly means many.00:06:36	T	And remember this sheet of paper here, you've used this before when we were graphing,00:06:42	T	to try to get as much information as you can about polymers because what can you do with this sheet of paper, that I'll let you do?00:06:49	SN	Cheat.00:06:50	T	Yeah, yeah. You can use this for a test. Okay, Sam, uh, Terrence?00:06:53	SN	They're gigantic molecules?00:06:54	T	They're gigantic molecules.00:07:05	T	Okay. Um, Daphne?00:07:07	SN	Mono means one.00:07:09	T	Mono means one. And what's so important about mono?00:07:15	S	It takes three mono's to make a polymer.00:07:17	T	Well, it takes more than three mono's to make a polymer, cause we, cause //they're gigantic molecules,00:07:20	S	//Oh, okay.00:07:21	T	but give me kind of a definition of a monomer?00:07:24	S	A monomer-00:07:26	T	You kind of gave it to me, but kind of rephrase that.00:07:30	T	In other words, Daphne, if I were to ask you what is a monomer, what would you tell me?00:07:34	SN	A chain? Wait-00:07:45	T	Anybody? What is a monomer? Uh, Aimee.00:07:48	SN	Are they simple molecules?00:07:50	T	Yeah, they're simple molecules, so if we take the simple molecules, Daphne, we put them all together inside of a chain, what have we created?00:07:59	SN	A polymer.00:08:00	T	Bingo! So mono means what?00:08:02	S	One.00:08:03	T	One. Okay, good. Anybody else? Crystal?00:08:07	SN	Polymers are molecules joined together.00:08:10	T	Mono- okay, polymers are molecules joined together. And they're joined together, how are they joined together?00:08:17	T	I mean if you have to describe what they look like when they were joined together what would you tell me?00:08:26	SN	(inaudible), I don't know, like, they're just around each other.00:08:30	T	They're around one another and they're linked together. What are they linked together in, Samantha?00:08:35	SN	Kinda cross linked-00:08:36	T	They can be- polymers can be linked together with a cross linker,00:08:39	T	but if you want to take a whole bunch of monomers and link them together what have you kind of created?00:08:47	SN	A chain?00:08:48	T	Bingo! Thank you, a chain. Okay. So joined together and they're kind of like in chains, or they can be in chains,00:08:56	T	but with the ones that we talked about were in chains, okay? Anything else you want to add to this?00:09:01	SN	"Mer" means molecules?00:09:03	T	Okay, we can write: "mer."00:09:07	T	I was trying to kinda remember, Gi-, remember "molecule," okay? Samantha?00:09:13	SN	They can be all scrunched together?00:09:17	T	Okay.00:09:18	S	Up and down and side to side.00:09:20	T	Okay, good and this is what was really important because we're gonna take what Samantha has said,00:09:25	T	and we're gonna take this one step further today in class.00:09:29	T	Samantha mentioned that the polymers can kind of in chains- can kinda be arranged two different ways.00:09:35	T	She said, "side to side" and we'll call that "parallel" today. And then how's the other one? Do you remember?00:09:41	SN	Scrunched together.00:09:42	T	Scrunched together kinda like?00:09:44	SN	Crisscross?00:09:45	T	Kinda like crisscrossed. Okay.00:09:51	T	Okay, and this, ladies and gents, is what we're gonna focus on today, okay?00:09:55	T	We're gonna talk about parallel and cross linked chains and what actually does that do to the polymer.00:10:00	T	You guys remember the polymer, the newspaper polymer, do you guys remember that?00:10:05	SN	Mm-hm.00:10:06	T	Do you guys remember that? Can somebody here tell me how were the chains arranged in the newspaper? How were the chains arranged?00:10:12	T	Dave?00:10:13	SN	Like in order, the-00:10:15	T	Were they more arranged parallel or were they arranged crisscross?00:10:18	S	Parallel.00:10:19	T	They were parallel and because they were arranged parallel what could you what could you do to the newspaper?00:10:23	S	Rip it easy.00:10:24	T	You could rip it very, very easily. Okay, what was the other thing that we used in class? Does anybody remember?00:10:30	T	Aimee?00:10:31	SN	Tyvek.00:10:32	T	Tyvek. And how were the molecules arranged in the Tyvek?00:10:35	S	Crisscross.00:10:36	T	They're crisscross, and what did the crisscross molecules do to the Tyvek?00:10:40	SN	Made it hard to tear.00:10:41	T	Made it very, very hard to tear. Okay? All right, so remembering that- parallel and crisscrossed-00:10:47	T	we're gonna go ahead and we're gonna take a look at this and we're gonna take a look at these arrangements of these chains,00:10:53	T	and how that kinda helps us determine what is ac- actually gonna happen to the polymer; how is the polymer gonna behave? Okay?00:10:59	T	All right, what I'd like you to do right now is take out one clean sheet of notebook paper,00:11:04	T	and if you would do me a favor and put your notebook on the floor, so the only thing that should be on your desk is a piece of notebook paper.00:11:36	T	Okay, I'm going to go over here on the overhead, guys; I'm not gonna turn the lights off because I'm not gonna be up here for very long, okay?00:11:45	T	But, what I want you to do, on your piece of paper, which is gonna kinda help us with the labs that we're gonna do a little bit later on;00:11:59	T	we are going to look at polymer chains, so what I'd like for you to do is to write down polymer chains-00:12:05	T	and this is a little bit background information-00:12:08	T	kind of a r- kind of a review from what we did last class period, but also to let you know where we're going with the lesson today.00:12:32	T	Okay.00:12:35	T	This is "monomers." You guys remember that when we kinda drew this picture of nylon last class period? Okay?00:12:42	T	This is actually polystyrene, which is up here; it's a plastic container.00:12:45	T	And one of the really, really neat things is that if you look at the polymers,00:12:50	T	and you look at all the names of the polymers, what's at the beginning of all the names of the- of the chemical names of the polymers?00:12:57	SS	Poly.00:12:58	T	P-o-l-y, Poly, and that gives you a really, really good idea that that must be a polymer because it has p-o-l-y on it.00:13:09	T	And if we remember we've got one carbon atom; we have two hydrogen atoms that are bonded together to another carbon and hydrogen,00:13:18	T	that's your (monomeer), you take a whole bunch of monomers together and what have you created?00:13:23	SN	Polymer.00:13:24	SN	A polymer.00:13:25	T	A polymer. Okay, good. Okay, this is what we're gonna concentrate on in class today.00:13:30	T	The arrangement of chains can influence the behavior of the polymers.00:13:46	T	And it kinda goes back to our little bubble over there where we were talking about compounds are formed by combining two or more elements,00:13:52	T	whose properties are different from the original elements.00:13:55	T	Here you have a whole bunch of elements, you put them together and you've created something brand new.00:14:36	T	Okay. Based on what we talked about last class period- we talked about the newspaper and we talked about the Tyvek-00:14:43	T	would you please write down on your paper how the polymer chains were arranged in the newspaper,00:14:49	T	and how they were arranged in the Tyvek.00:14:55	SN	Can we draw it?00:14:56	T	You may draw it. Absolutely.00:15:33	T	And would you also please write down, where Tyvek- uh, newspaper and Tyvek- would you also please tell me:00:15:39	T	what- how did that newspaper behave? In other words, because the polymer chains were arranged in such a way,00:15:47	T	how did the newspaper behave as far as tearing is concerned?00:16:54	T	Okay. Questions so far? Questions? Questions? Okay. Excellent! All righty.00:17:00	T	We're gonna go now into investigating polymers; and what I'd like for you to do on the same sheet of paper,00:17:06	T	is "Investigating Polymers Activity Part One." And this is gonna be a demo that I'm going to do, and then after the demo is over,00:17:13	T	I'm gonna break you up into your lab groups and then you guys are gonna take a polymer00:17:17	T	and you're going to investigate a polymer on your own, with your group.00:17:57	T	Okay.00:18:05	T	All righty. The first polymer- Jim, you want to share something?00:18:12	SN	Uh, no.00:18:13	T	Okay. First polymer that I'm gonna share with you is- I want you to write this down on your piece of paper-00:18:19	T	it's this one right up in here. It's called plumber's tape. I don't know if you guys can see it from here.00:18:24	T	And you can really, really impress your parents today when you go home, and you can ask for plumber's tape, because that's what it's just-00:18:32	T	if you go into Home Depot and you say, "I need plumber's tape," they know exactly what you're talking about.00:18:37	T	But if you go into Home Depot and say, "I need poly tetra fluoro ethylene," they may not know what you're talking about.00:18:51	T	Here you've got the "poly" which means the "many." Does anybody here know what "tetra" means?00:18:56	SN	Uh, like, uh-00:18:59	T	"Tetra" means a number. Can you-00:19:00	S	Yeah. It means, like- hold on, no, I thought (inaudible).00:19:03	T	Anybody here know what "tetra" means? Okay, tetra is a number.00:19:07	T	Usually what happens up in here is that they'll actually tell you how many of those, uh, molecules are actually bonded together.00:19:15	T	Fluoro is probably fluorine off of the, uh, element table and then ethylene is also another couple of different elements off of the Periodic Table.00:19:23	T	So you put all of these together and you'll get them all in a nice big old polymer chain and you create plumber's tape.00:19:28	T	Has anybody here ever fooled around with plumber's tape before? Do you guys know what I'm talking about?00:19:32	SN	Duct tape?00:19:33	T	This stuff. Not duct tape, plumber's tape.00:19:35	S	Oh.00:19:36	SN	Yeah.00:19:37	T	That's plumber's tape in here. Jim, share your experiences with plumber's tape.00:19:40	SN	Yeah, its not sticky but it's like- it's when you wrap it, it squeezes really tight around things, it's like Teflon tape.00:19:48	S	You can fix gas leaks with it. That's what I used it for.00:19:51	T	Okay. And, that's what I use it for, to fix gas leaks and also it's really, really good for uh, water pipes and threading things like that, too.00:20:00	T	As a matter of fact, yeah, also known as Teflon, so you're correct in that assumption. Yes, Charlotte?00:20:05	SN	I wrapped it around my finger and it turned my finger all purple.00:20:08	T	Well, yeah I think so. If you wrap anything around your finger it's gonna turn your finger all purple. Anybody else?00:20:14	T	Okay, I don't have a lot of plumber's tape to go around, but what I'm gonna do,00:20:19	T	is that I'm going to pass some plumber's tape around to some volunteers in the audience.00:20:25	T	Does anybody want to take a look at the plumber's tape?00:20:28	T	And I kinda dispersed it around that way you- people around you can take a look at it, too.00:20:33	T	The only thing that I'd like for you to do with the plumber's tape when you get it, is just to kinda leave it on your desk.00:20:38	T	Don't do anything to it other than just leave it on your desk. Nice and flat if you possibly can.00:20:49	T	Let's see. Jessica, I'll give you some. Theo-00:20:59	T	Okay, can everybody- Samantha, I'm going to give you some since you guys can take a look at that.00:21:03	T	What about over here on this side of the room?00:21:09	T	Okay, Jason, I'm gonna get you a piece, too, I think I have another piece up here. Okay. Yeah.00:21:20	SN	You can't touch it?00:21:21	T	Yes, you can.00:21:22	T	You just leave it flat. Touch it and you can actually see how flimsy this is, too.00:21:26	T	And actually they'll make another type, this is more for, pipes and there is another one that's a little bit more flimsier.00:21:35	T	That's what we used this morning for threading, water pipes and stuff like that.00:21:38	SN	How does it stick under the pipe?00:21:40	T	Actually, it just does it by, whe- eh, you're gonna figure that out. Okay? I'm not gonna tell you, you're gonna figure that one out. Okay.00:21:47	T	For those of you in here who have plumber's tape: do me a favor;00:21:53	T	see whether or not your ink pen or pencil, whatever that you're using on it right now, that you can write your initials on it.00:22:00	T	See if you can do that. With the plumber's tape.00:22:02	T	If you guys want to feel it, who doesn't have any, you guys can actually see what that feels like.00:22:09	T	It's kinda really smooth; it kinda feels good.00:22:12	SN	Mine won't work.00:22:13	T	Huh?00:22:14	S	It ripped through.00:22:15	SN	Me too.00:22:16	T	That's okay, it ripped through? Okay then maybe you don't want to go in too deep, then.00:22:18	T	Then don't, don't do that, then if it's ripping through, cause it's not a good thing. Oh good.00:22:25	SN	Miss?00:22:28	T	Cool. Okay, good.00:22:30	T	All right, ladies and gents, we know this is a polymer because I told you that.00:22:35	T	The job is now to figure out how the polymer chains are arranged. We know the polymer chains can be arranged two different ways.00:22:42	T	They can be arranged parallel to one another, or they can be arranged crisscross.00:22:48	T	And if you had your super duper eyeballs on right now you actually could see this, you actually could see the polymer chains;00:22:53	T	but we can't see the polymer chains, so we don't have the super duper eyeballs,00:22:57	T	so we're gonna have to do a couple of things to it to try to figure out how the polymer chains are inside the Teflon or inside the plumber's tape.00:23:05	T	So what I'd like for you to do, is that you have the tape like this, lengthwise on your desk- everybody, Jason, got it? Okay.00:23:13	T	Now, do you see the tape? You see the top part of the tape and you see the bottom part of the tape? Top and the bottom part of the tape?00:23:20	T	I want you to ever so gently stretch it out. Just ever so gently stretch it out.00:23:26	T	Don't stretch it out to the point where you're gonna tear it, but go along your tape and ever so gently stretch it out. From top to bottom.00:23:36	T	Okay? And, other people in the classroom, if you want to take a look at what they're doing, make sure they're doing it right?00:23:44	T	See, it kinda makes a cute little ribbon.00:23:48	T	Okay?00:23:49	SN	I didn't make a cute little ribbon.00:23:50	T	You didn't make a cute little ribbon?00:23:52	SN	No, mine's (inaudible), and then we got a pink //(inaudible)-00:23:53	T	//Okay.00:23:54	SN	It looks like yellow bacon.00:23:55	T	Looks like yellow bacon, okay. So, that's something that I could do with this. Okay, can you guys see that? All right.00:24:02	T	Now, I stretched it this way. Did that tell me anything about how the chains were? //In the- in the tape?00:24:09	SN	//Yeah.00:24:10	SN	No.00:24:11	T	Did you learn anything about how the chains were aligned in the tape? No you didn't. Okay.00:24:15	T	Now what I want you to do, is take one end and take the other end and I want you ever so gently to stretch it that way.00:24:25	T	And tell me what happens.00:24:29	SN	The chains... go back to normal.00:24:32	SN	Back to normal.00:24:33	T	It goes back to normal. Okay? And if you want to have your other partners or somebody who didn't have a chance to do this, do this again.00:24:40	T	It's stretching this way; and I'm kinda getting a little distorted- if I were to write my name on it and stretch it like this,00:24:46	T	my name would be real distorted.00:24:47	T	But if I were to pull like this I would have my name nice- nice and original again; normal again.00:24:54	T	What does this tell you?00:24:55	T	Someone in here raise your hand and tell me what you think this tells you about how the polymer chains are arranged.00:25:02	T	Do you think the chains are arranged parallel to one another or do you think they're crisscrossed? Based on what this can do.00:25:10	T	Do you think they're parallel to one another or do you think that they're crisscrossed? Depending on what I can do with this.00:25:24	T	I see some hands going up. Some hands going up.00:25:32	T	Jessica.00:25:33	SN	Parallel.00:25:34	T	They're parallel. And why do you think they're parallel?00:25:36	S	Because you can stretch it from side to side and it's kind of easy to do, and if it was crisscrossed it would be harder.00:25:44	T	Yeah. I agree with that. I don't know if you kinda heard what Jessica said,00:25:48	T	but she said because of the fact that you could pull them side to side and then you can get it to go back into its original shape again,00:25:55	T	just by pulling it this way, its giving you an indication that the chains are parallel.00:25:59	T	If the chains were crisscrossed do you think we'd be able to get it back to its original way real quick? No, we don't. Okay.00:26:05	T	So, what I want you to do on your paper right now- you've written down "plumber's tape"-00:26:08	T	what I need you to do now, is to tell me in your own words, what evidence- or how did you know in other words with the chains-00:26:20	T	How were the chains arranged?00:26:33	T	And what evidence do you have00:26:40	T	that the chains were arranged in that certain way?00:26:42	T	In other words, if you think that the chains were arranged parallel,00:26:45	T	then tell me what evidence did you see that gives you an indication that the chains were arranged parallel.00:27:13	T	(inaudible), well you really got yours stretched out, huh?00:27:16	SN	(inaudible) I had- I got carried away with it.00:27:17	T	You got carried away with it, so what do you think happened to your poor chains?00:27:20	S	I ripped it.00:27:21	T	Yeah.00:27:22	S	You ripped it, too.00:27:23	T	And I ripped it too.00:27:27	T	This brings up a point. Jason's poor plumber's tape, he really got it really stretched out.00:27:33	S	But I (supported) my scientific thing.00:27:38	T	You- okay. You took it one step further. What do you think happened to these poor polymer chains? From what Jason did to them?00:27:45	T	What do you think happened?00:27:46	SN	They got //broken.00:27:47	SN	//They got stretched too far so they ripped.00:27:49	T	Yeah. Stretched too far so they ripped, very good.00:27:54	SN	Okay, whenever you stretch the tape out do the chains get more compressed or do they just come closer together;00:27:59	SN	or do they actually get more like- do they all get thinner?00:28:02	T	They will actually stretch out and get thinner. Well, I shouldn't- and sometimes that all depends, too.00:28:11	T	Okay? All right.00:28:15	T	Now, I'll give you about another minute to finish this up because the next part I have not been successful with all day long,00:28:22	T	and I hope I'm going to be successful with it today. I was semi-successful with it yesterday.00:28:30	T	Jim?00:28:31	SN	But still, if you got, like, your arm cut off or something, then all your polymer chains will be cut and everything?00:28:35	T	Oh, absolutely.00:28:36	S	Oh. Oh.00:28:39	T	Absolutely.00:28:40	S	Then how do you have polymer chains in your blood, DNA, and everything?00:28:42	T	Well that's because you got to consider all polymers as a gigantic molecule. It's smaller molecules put together.00:28:48	T	So all the molecules that you have- not all, but quite a few of them- are gigantic molecules00:28:53	T	and all they are just smaller molecules that are hooked up together.00:28:56	S	So whenever, like, you find a piece of DNA that's not like your entire DNA string, //(it's just a little piece).00:29:02	T	//No it's not. It's a little //piece.00:29:03	S	//So is your entire DNA string, like, going up and down through your body all the way?00:29:07	T	No. You've got to remember, if you remember this in seventh-grade science, if you were to take a cell and look inside of your nucleus,00:29:13	T	that big old gigantic molecule is really, really, coiled inside the nucleus. Do you guys, do remember that? Okay.00:29:20	T	And, yeah, and you can actually stretch that molecule out its very, very long.00:29:25	T	But it's not all up and down your arm. It's compacted inside of every single cell inside of your body, that has a nucleus.00:29:33	S	How are polymers arranged inside the body?00:29:36	T	It all depends. All depends. Um, some could be arranged parallel, some could be arranged crisscross, some could be cross-linked together.00:29:45	T	All depends on what they're what they're needed for, what they're used for. Okay? Any questions? Any other questions?00:29:51	T	Okay, this one I haven't been- like I said I've been somewhat successful with it all day long, but I'm not a hundred percent sure,00:29:58	T	this will be the last demo that I do and them I'm gonna break you up into your lab groups for you to investigate your own polymer.00:30:04	T	Did somebody in here know how to blow up a balloon really, really well and tie it off?00:30:08	SN	I do!00:30:09	SN	I do.00:30:11	SN	(inaudible)00:30:12	SN	Jason pulled (inaudible).00:30:13	T	Jason-00:30:17	T	Do me a favor, when you blow the balloons up, don't blow them up all the way.00:30:22	SN	Okay, (inaudible).00:30:28	T	No, ta-, that's- that's cool, right there. That's good.00:30:41	SN	(inaudible)00:30:42	T	Thank you.00:30:44	T	Thank you. And Jason is dying over there, huh?00:30:50	SN	I like balloons.00:30:53	T	Thank you. Okay. All right, we've got another problem.00:30:59	T	We have found another polymer and we want to investigate again how the polymer- the chains in this polymer are arranged, okay?00:31:07	T	So we're gonna do a couple of things to the balloon to figure it out. Uh, what I'm going to do I'm gonna take a skewer.00:31:13	T	I'll dip it in some oil just to be on the safe side to make it go in a little bit, how should I say, a little //smoother. Okay?00:31:19	SN	//Easy?00:31:20	T	Where should I put the skewer? Somebody in here tell me. I want to see whether I can figure out,00:31:26	T	like we did with the plumber's tape we stretched it different ways to see whether or not we could figure out how the chains are going.00:31:31	T	Uh, same thing with the balloon. Jim, //what do you think?00:31:33	SN	//Right on top00:31:34	S	Poke it right on top.00:31:35	T	Poke it on the top?00:31:36	S	Yeah, right there.00:31:37	T	Okay. Anybody want to go in the side?00:31:40	T	Ah, Stuart wants to go on the side. Okay, Stuart doesn't want to go on the side, all right.00:31:45	T	Stuart, we're gonna go on the side, for you, okay?00:31:48	T	We're gonna go on the side. What do you think's gonna happen?00:31:50	SS	Pop!00:31:51	SN	Pop.00:31:52	SN	It's gonna pop.00:31:53	T	Why?00:31:54	SN	I think it'll go through. I think.00:31:55	T	You think it'll go through?00:31:56	S	Yeah.00:31:57	T	Okay, let's see what happens. Okay, ready?00:32:01	T	Oh golly, //that popped.00:32:02	S	//That popped; that was a big one.00:32:03	T	Okay.00:32:07	S	Now do it right in the bottom; right where all the thick stuff is.00:32:09	T	Right where all the thick stuff is, huh?00:32:11	S	Yeah, might not pop there.00:32:12	T	Do you think the, the, the thick stuff is not on the side?00:32:17	S	No.00:32:18	T	No?00:32:19	SN	No, cause-00:32:20	SN	Cause it's stretched out inside there on the top, but down where the bottom is it's not blown up all the way, so it's thicker on the bottom.00:32:23	T	Okay. Let's find out. Okay.00:32:25	SN	(inaudible)00:32:26	T	Okay.00:32:28	S	(inaudible) popped.00:32:34	T	Just to be on the safe side.00:32:38	S	Oh, it still popped!00:32:40	T	That's because I haven't been successful //with this all day long.00:32:41	S	//Try the bottom, the bottom. Where the little tie thing is.00:32:44	SN	No, put it-00:32:45	SN	At the bottom.00:32:46	SN	Where it's tied.00:32:47	T	Tie thing?00:32:48	SS	Yeah.00:32:49	T	Okay.00:32:52	T	I don't like that one.00:32:54	SN	Yeah, get a new one.00:32:55	T	Okay.00:32:56	S	I wanna see that one (inaudible).00:32:59	T	You're sure, huh?00:33:01	T	Oh!00:33:02	S	There we go!00:33:03	S	Now the other side.00:33:04	SS	Ah!00:33:06	SN	(inaudible) too long.00:33:07	SN	Here I'll blow one up again.00:33:08	T	Okay. Well whatev- give me two more, cause I told you: sometimes I'm- this is working and sometimes its not.00:33:14	T	But so far we got one part of it working, right?00:33:16	SS	(inaudible) yes, sure.00:33:18	T	And don't blow them up really too- don't stretch them out too much.00:33:21	SN	I want the long one.00:33:23	T	Here, try that one.00:33:24	SN	Oh, yes.00:33:26	T	Okay, good.00:33:33	T	Thank you. Perfect.00:33:37	SN	(inaudible)00:33:38	T	I'm gonna be successful with this.00:33:40	S	Yes.00:33:42	S	Use the force.00:33:43	T	Use the force. Okay.00:33:49	T	All righty. Here I go! Should I try a different skewer?00:33:52	S	//Yeah, they're bad luck.00:33:53	T	//Okay. Okay. Here we go! I'm gonna go from this end first.00:33:58	SN	It's gonna pop.00:33:59	SN	It's gonna pop.00:34:00	T	Don't say that!00:34:01	SN	Oh well.00:34:03	SN	Pop.00:34:04	SN	There we go!00:34:05	T	Ah! Success.00:34:06	S	This is my balloon! It's my (inaudible).00:34:08	T	Okay, okay. All righty.00:34:11	T	What you need to do now is that- I was- when I put the skewer going in this way, it popped;00:34:16	T	but when I put the skewer I this way, it didn't pop.00:34:20	T	What's the difference between the chains here and the chains here?00:34:25	T	What's the difference? What's the difference? Crystal?00:34:28	SN	It's parallel.00:34:29	T	Well, don't know if it's parallel. What's the difference between the way the chains are arranged here?00:34:33	T	Not so much whether their parallel or crisscross right now, but Jim had said this before. Jason?00:34:39	SN	Uh, the ones on the side are like, I guess, like so stretched apart that it, when you hook something in it,00:34:44	S	it just, like, makes it pop cause it won't stretch into where you (inaudible) to go inside.00:34:48	T	Okay, and then what about the top?00:34:50	S	And then the ones on top aren't as, like, stretched apart or pulled so tightly;00:34:54	S	they're so loose so you can just stick something in it and (it will) pop right away.00:34:57	T	Okay, excellent. So how do you think the polymer chains are arranged? Do you think they're parallel or you think they're crisscrossed?00:35:01	S	Ones on the top are parallel and the ones on the side are crisscrossed?00:35:06	T	Okay. Anybody else (has anything) different, Jim?00:35:08	SN	I believe the ones on the top may be crisscrossed because that means they're closer together and then so you could stick something through,00:35:16	S	and they, like, squeeze around it easier and do not have to (explode);00:35:19	S	and the ones on the bottom and the ones on the side are stretched out a little more so they're more like crisscrossed,00:35:23	S	so when you stick something in they just like (inaudible).00:35:26	T	Okay.00:35:27	SN	(Question.)00:35:27	T	Okay. I like that explanation. And what Jim said was, he felt that the polymer chains are crisscrossed.00:35:35	T	The ones at the top are crisscrossed, they're not stretched out, so when you poke something through it, the chains just kind of- what was the word that you used?00:35:43	SN	Squeezed around it.00:35:44	T	They kind of squeeze around it, whereas a polymer chain- the crisscross polymer chains on the side are a little bit more stretched out,00:35:51	T	and so when you try to put a skewer through it, are you really getting- you don't- they can't squeeze together.00:35:56	T	I think that's the word that he used. The polymer chains can't squeeze together. Okay?00:35:59	T	So, we learned that the balloon is what type of polymer? Parallel or crisscrossed?00:36:04	SS	Crisscrossed.00:36:05	T	Crisscrossed. And this is a little bit more compacted than this over here. So what- what can you tell me about polymers?00:36:15	T	Think about this. According to the balloon, what can polymers do? What could we do to them?00:36:24	T	Somebody's saying it, I can hear it.00:36:25	SN	They can stretch out.00:36:26	T	Yeah, they can stretch out, so polymers can stretch out.00:36:29	T	What I want you to do here now: same thing, same question. How are the chains arranged,00:36:36	T	and what evidence do you have if the chains are arranged that way?00:36:43	T	And if you guys want to draw a picture, you can go for it and draw a picture, it's not a problem.00:37:05	T	Okay.00:37:48	T	So, just out of curiosity, going back to that little original statement that we started out with today in class:00:37:53	T	the arrangement of the chains can- can kinda give me an idea of what's gonna happen to the behavior of the polymer;00:38:00	T	and chains- crisscrossed, stretched out in the balloon- made the balloon pop;00:38:07	T	chains compacted together at the top: I can put a skewer through it and it's not going to pop.00:38:15	T	Okay, so the way the chains are arranged, tells me something about the behavior of the material.00:38:30	T	(inaudible) is not here. Are you understanding this all okay? Okay.00:38:36	T	He hasn't been here for a while. Was he on vacation? He is? Okay.00:38:47	T	Okay, it looks like pencils are down.00:38:50	T	All right, somebody now: tell me something else I can write on this paper, what I just know about polymers.00:38:57	T	What did you learn about polymers today? What could you write down on there?00:39:01	T	Cedrick?00:39:02	SN	Polymers can expand.00:39:04	T	Oh yes, polymers can expand.00:39:12	T	Or you can use the word "we can stretch the polymers out."00:39:15	T	Anything else? How's bingo? Bingo, bingo. Okay, nothing else? Nothing else.00:39:24	T	Okay, please go ahead and take this paper, now flip it over to the back, because now I'm going to let you investigate one on your own.00:39:31	T	Okay? All righty.00:39:35	T	And the one I'm going to have you investigate on your own, is this one here.00:39:40	T	I'm going to go ahead and turn the overhead back on;00:39:43	T	and you may want to copy this down, or you should copy this down on the back of your paper,00:39:47	T	so that there's not going to be any questions- you won't have any questions when you go into a lab, hopefully.00:39:51	T	Okay, investigating polymers. We investigated the balloon and we investigated the plumber's tape.00:39:59	T	I'm gonna have you go out and investigate the- a plastic container, or the polystyrene.00:40:07	T	And that's what you're going to investigate right there.00:40:11	T	Again, we have this question in our head, we have to figure out how these chains are arranged.00:40:17	T	You're gonna do a couple of things to this plastic container to see whether or not you can figure out how the chains are arranged.00:40:28	T	And here's a monomer,00:40:32	T	a polystyrene-00:40:45	T	Okay.00:40:55	T	(And), as you're writing this I'm gonna go ahead and share with you, you guys can go into your lab group, three to a lab group.00:41:03	T	You may choose who you'd like to work with and after I go over the instructions I'm gonna tell you,00:41:09	T	"Okay guys, you have a minute to fi- or actually 30 seconds to find the partners and a lab station," okay?00:41:17	T	Okay, so I know you're all looking around at one another going "yeah, yeah, yeah," okay? Okay.00:41:25	T	But let me have your eyeballs back up here because we gotta go through this.00:41:28	T	Okay, first thing: you're gonna take your polystyrene container, your plastic container,00:41:33	T	and I'm gonna show you what the plastic containers look like. Plastic containers look like this.00:41:39	T	You guys all recognize these plastic containers. Where do you see these?00:41:46	T	Look!00:41:47	SN	Oh those are the cheesy hamburgers you get-00:41:49	T	Yeah, the cheesy hamburgers are in there. Yeah, okay? In the cafeteria.00:41:52	T	All right, what you're gonna do is that you're going to take this plastic container and you're going to cut into a shape.00:42:00	T	And you guys can choose whether you want to cut it into a square, rectangle, or triangle.00:42:05	T	The only reason why I'm asking you for those three particular shapes is because they're kinda easier to measure.00:42:10	T	I don't care how big you cut this out; I don't care how small you cut this out, that's your choice.00:42:17	T	What I would like for you to concentrate on in the container, though, is if-00:42:25	T	there's a very, very flat part to the container. Do you guys see the flat part?00:42:28	T	Okay, so when you get into your lab groups, you just need to make sure that you're cutting off those ripply edge stuff.00:42:35	T	Okay?00:42:38	T	And I'm not doing a very good job.00:42:47	T	I cut the flat part out. Okay, from the flat part-00:42:52	T	from the flat part then you can cut your triangle, you can cut your square, you can cut your rectangle and you guys can cut it any size.00:42:59	T	Just remember you have two flat sections here for three people.00:43:04	T	So you're gonna have to figure out how you're going to divvy up two sections for three people, okay?00:43:09	T	All right, so that's the first thing you're gonna do. Second thing that you're gonna do-00:43:14	T	and I had a piece here from this morning don't know what happened to it-00:43:18	T	you're going to trace the figure.00:43:20	T	So once you cut the figure out, I want you to trace it, and then I want you to take measurements.00:43:28	T	And I'm gonna tell you how I want you to take these measurements.00:43:35	T	You have rulers, in your containers back there at your lab station. What you need to do, is that you need to measure the sides. Okay?00:43:47	T	I don't want to know length, times width, times height, I don't want to know that;00:43:50	T	all I want you to do to is tell me how- just take the measurement of the length or actually, of all the four sides;00:43:58	T	or if you have a triangle then you have three sides, okay? You're gonna take these measurements in?00:44:04	SS	Centimeters.00:44:05	T	Centimeters. Then, you are going to go and you're going to give me a measurement of mass.00:44:18	T	Now, what is in the classroom that's going to help you figure out how the mass of the little piece of plastic?00:44:24	T	What's hanging around here? Daphne?00:44:26	SN	The triple beam balance.00:44:27	T	The triple beam balance. So you're gonna use the triple beam balance to help you figure out the mass. And how do you measure mass? In?00:44:33	SS	Grams.00:44:34	T	Grams, okay.00:44:36	T	And then, give me some characteristics of the plastic. In other words, after you've cut your little shape out, tell me, what does it look like?00:44:45	T	Tell me something about the physical characteristics of that piece of plastic.00:44:52	T	What does it feel like? What does it smell like? Don't taste it.00:45:05	T	And you're going to do all of this two times. You're going to do this- yeah, watch, before you heat it and then after you heat it.00:45:15	T	Where as with the plumber's tape we pulled it and as with the balloon we skewered it,00:45:20	T	with this piece of plastic we're gonna put it in the toaster oven and we're gonna see what happens.00:45:25	T	So I've got the toaster oven up here. I'm gonna man the toaster oven.00:45:33	T	So, once it's been heated you're gonna take it back to your lab station and you're gonna do all this all over again. Question?00:45:40	SN	What if- what if whenever we heat it, it like melts and we can't touch it?00:45:44	T	Oh, I don't know we'll have to see. Okay? We'll have to see.00:45:49	T	You have to put all this information, the before and the after heating into a data table.00:45:57	T	You guys remember what your data tables looked like from before in the past, right? Okay, I'm not gonna give you the data table today,00:46:04	T	I want you and your partners to figure out what your data table is going to look like.00:46:08	T	You just need to know that your data table has to have all of these elements inside of it, before and after heating;00:46:14	T	and you have to have all of this for all three of you lab partners on one data table.00:46:20	T	So what I mean is: if Samantha, Terrence, and myself were a team, we would all cut out our own different shapes,00:46:27	T	we'd all cut out- figure out our own different measurements, but we would share them with one another.00:46:33	T	So by the time I'm done, I have Samantha's, Terrence's, and my own all on the data table. Before and after. Is that clear?00:46:42	SN	Yes.00:46:43	T	Is that clear? Because there was some confusion about that this morning in class. So you're gonna put everybody's data on here.00:46:49	T	You are going to trace everybody's figure on your paper.00:46:53	T	So when you create your data table you need to keep that in mind, okay? Cedrick? Question?00:46:58	SN	No, I just (inaudible).00:47:00	T	Okay. All righty.00:47:04	T	No questions? I think I've covered everything. Tuh-duh, tuh-duh... Yep, I have. Okay.00:47:11	T	When you are done with your before heating measurements and you want to come up to the toaster oven, raise your hand,00:47:18	T	and then I will call you, group by group, to the toaster oven. I'm gonna man it and then you can take your plastic back to the lab, okay?00:47:27	T	So when you're ready just raise your hand and I'll let you come up here and we'll put it in the toaster oven.00:47:34	T	If you're done with the whole entire lab, you're done with the before and you're done with the after,00:47:39	T	and you're done with all the measurements and everything else that you need to do,00:47:42	T	there are some conclusion questions that are on the board behind this board over here.00:47:48	T	And somewhere in the middle of the lab, I'll push that board over so that you actually can see those conclusion questions, okay?00:47:55	T	Ladies and gents, this is a lab today that you need to make sure that you are taking very careful measurements. What did I just say?00:48:05	SS	Very careful measurements.00:48:07	T	Okay, very careful measurements, because- I'm not gonna tell you, but yeah, just go ahead and take very careful measurements, okay?00:48:15	T	Okay, 30 seconds, find your partner and lab station.00:48:54	SN	Do you type those?00:48:57	T	Um, eyeballs?00:49:03	T	Let me double-check and see who you're working with real quick. Three, three, three, three. You three ladies are together?00:49:09	T	Julia, who are you with? You two. Okay. Three, it's you three?00:49:15	SN	Yeah.00:49:16	T	Okay, you three, and you three. Okay. Do me a favor, Monica, would you guys scoot down a little bit? Yeah, thank you.00:49:23	T	Keep scooting. That way we can get that group in totally over there.00:49:31	T	Scoot all- yeah, yeah, yeah, good. Arthur scoot down some more. Take your stool, yeah, take this stool and go right in the middle over there.00:49:41	T	Okay. Once I hand out your plastic containers, you guys can go ahead and start.00:49:58	T	Okay gentlemen, here you go.00:50:07	T	Oh yes, yes, hurry up. Give me your (inaudible) I'll give you a pass. You three ladies are together?00:50:14	SS	Mm-hm.00:50:15	T	Is it just you and Charlotte?00:50:17	SN	Yeah.00:50:18	T	Okay, (just go). There you go.00:50:25	T	Just you three gents? You got some extras here, so use this and that.00:50:30	SN	(inaudible)?00:50:31	T	Yeah, good question guys: if you need extra scissors or rulers they're on my table next to my lab station.00:50:59	T	(inaudible) background music, it has to be Star Wars.00:51:07	T	You know what, there is another pair of scissors on the lab table over there. Let me get you some (inaudible) containers.00:51:19	SN	(And then we) cut into this, right?00:51:20	SN	I don't know, (inaudible) whatever you want.00:51:23	SN	I'll get this (inaudible). It says, "Don't count (inaudible)."00:51:29	SN	That's why I'm counting right here.00:51:56	T	(inaudible) how are you gonna organize this data table?00:52:00	SN	Um-00:52:01	T	Mm... yeah?00:52:04	T	Yes, what do you need?00:52:07	SN	Do we need (to trim it) in three ways?00:52:08	T	Yes, you do. Okay?00:52:11	T	So if I were you, I would cut out whatever you have left over you can give to Leon.00:52:17	S	(Math).00:52:18	T	Okay, that's a good idea, too.00:52:20	SN	And that will be a rectangle.00:52:21	SN	(inaudible) made a whole square.00:52:23	T	Did you guys just get one container?00:52:25	SN	Yeah.00:52:26	T	No, here, two. Okay.00:52:27	SN	Rectangle, we got it.00:52:54	T	Jason, question?00:52:58	T	What do you need?00:52:59	SN	Rulers.00:53:00	T	They should be up there. Where are they? Oh, here they are.00:53:02	SN	I make a square.00:53:03	SN	What are you making?00:53:06	S	What are you making?00:53:07	T	I must have //put them away yesterday, by accident. There you go.00:53:08	SN	//Are you gonna make (inaudible) this?00:53:09	SN	A rectangle?00:53:10	SN	A rectangle?00:53:11	SN	(inaudible) (kind of) make a small one.00:53:15	SN	Okay, I've got one over here.00:53:19	S	How are we supposed to measure it, like... Are we supposed to just put all the measurements in order?00:53:24	SN	"Measure in centimeters."

Your polymer should have had the same mass before and after heating.01:26:43	T	This is what we call a conservation of mass, because the root word is "to conserve."01:26:49	T	Some of you in here when I was walking around the room- a lot of you hit this right on target, man, you got the same mass.01:26:56	T	Good job!

Did you still have the same amount of stuff- that you had when you started?01:27:14	T	Yeah! So what did you just do to the mass, what did that mass look like at the beginning?01:27:20	T	What did your piece of plastic look like at the beginning, before you put it in the oven?01:27:23	SN	Bigger. And thinner.01:27:25	T	It was maybe a lot bigger and thinner. What happened to you after you heated it?01:27:29	S	It shrunk and got really thick and not as flexible.01:27:33	T	Yeah, it just kinda shrunk, but it got thicker. So you just kinda changed the volume, but the mass is still there. Okay?01:27:41	T	Explain- and I kinda helped explain that just now- but I want you to explain why they should have had the same mass,01:27:47	T	and put that in your own words.01:27:49	T	Number three: "How do you think the polymer chains are arranged?"01:27:53	T	Now we're going back to this thing that we started at the beginning of the class period,01:27:57	T	about the polymers and the polymer chains being arranged.01:27:59	T	How do you think they're arranged, and how do you think the arrangement of the chains influenced the behavior of the plastic container?01:28:09	T	For example-01:28:20	T	Uh, for example, prior to heating, your plastic looked one way, after heating the plastic looked another way.01:28:29	T	What happened to the chains?

How did the arrangement- so how do you think the chains are arranged in a plastic?01:32:36	SN	Um, I think parallel, because you see the (inaudible).01:32:41	T	Okay, then how do the arrangement of the chains influence the behavior of the plastic container?01:32:46	T	In other words the chains were arranged in a certain way based on what you said.01:32:51	T	When you heated it, how did that- what did that to the plastic container?01:32:57	S	Mm-hm.01:33:00	T	I know.01:34:37	SN	(inaudible)01:34:38	T	Mm-hm.

Uh, let's see. I told you about your assignment.01:36:55	T	Hold onto your polymer assignment until next Tuesday, because then what we'll do is that we'll kinda touch base a little bit01:37:02	T	about some of things that you found out about polymers, on Tuesday, from these activities,01:37:08	T	and we're going to go ahead and we're going to add it to the piece of paper over there, okay?01:37:13	T	Okay, are they're any questions?01:37:18	T	Questions?
