Top of Form00:00:03	T	All right, let me show you something from yesterday.00:00:17	T	Given enough time, and enough... depth, what's gonna happen to the sediments?00:00:28	T	What's gonna happen, there Yolanda?00:00:30	S	It's gonna become cemented.00:00:33	T	That's good.00:00:38	T	Now if- how are you gonna spot, how are you gonna identify sedimentary rock when you see it?00:00:49	T	What's (it have)?00:00:54	S	You have deposition.00:00:56	T	Well, you're telling us certainly how it's made.00:01:00	S	Yeah.00:01:01	T	And, you know, that's certainly a good thing, all right? But I- I just want to come back to this.00:01:09	SN	Yeah.00:01:10	T	You know, we know how it's made.00:01:13	T	Sediments get deposited, buried and cemented together, as Yolanda tells us, and it forms sedimentary rock.00:01:23	T	But my question is, how are you gonna spot it, how are you gonna identify it when you see it?00:01:31	T	There's a lot of roads that are cut from sedimentary rock, and you can see it if you know what to look for.00:01:40	T	What's that, Samuel?00:01:42	SN	When it- certain rocks might have layers on it.00:01:45	T	Oh.00:01:53	T	Let's see.00:01:57	T	Like that?00:01:58	SN	Yeah.00:01:59	SN	Yeah.00:02:00	T	Now, how do you know that's sedimentary rock?00:02:01	SN	Because it's-00:02:02	T	How do you know? How do you know? How do you know, Nikita? Look at it.00:02:09	S	Because it's stuck together.00:02:11	T	How do you know it's stuck together?00:02:13	SN	Because it's in layers.00:02:15	T	Say that.00:02:16	S	Because it's in layers.00:02:17	T	Okay. That's what- who said that?00:02:19	SN	Me.00:02:20	T	That's what Samuel said. Absolutely. Absolutely.00:02:25	T	So, you know, just in a cross-section, looking at it from the side, it appears like that.00:02:34	T	All right. Now, how do you- why do you suppose you can see the layers here? Because if this river wasn't here, you wouldn't see the layers.00:02:42	T	What did the river do to the rock? At least the sedimentary rock? What's happening here, Corey?00:02:48	SN	(inaudible) make stratas.00:02:50	T	That's good. You know, the word- that's a good word. Another word for layers are strata.00:02:58	T	Okay, but what did the river do to the sedimentary rock?00:03:05	T	We did this. What is that, Eric?00:03:08	SN	It cuts into it.00:03:09	T	That's right. So here's a wonderful example of a river- it's the Colorado River- cutting a canyon,00:03:17	T	and in canyons, if the river is cutting through sedimentary rock, you could see the layer. Now, let me ask you this.00:03:25	T	Suppose- and this was our little model from yesterday- suppose when the sediments got deposited in- in some ancient sea.00:03:39	T	Sorry.00:03:41	T	Suppose- suppose an animal, the remains of an animal, got deposited in the river along with the sediments.00:03:52	T	So now we have an animal, you know, that could have been buried... a million years ago, 10 million years ago, 50 million years ago.00:04:05	T	What do you think's gonna happen to that animal?00:04:12	T	Rudy, what do you think?00:04:13	SN	It's gonna blend into the rocks, with the rest of the sediments.00:04:18	T	That's right. Now, there's a word for that. There's a word for that.00:04:26	T	What's that, Sonia?00:04:28	SN	Becomes fossilized.00:04:29	T	That's good. Very good.00:04:38	T	I'd love to pass it around, but since it's sedimentary rock- you can see the layers here- I'm afraid that it's gonna fall down and crack.00:04:46	T	So I'll just come around. How do you like that, Terrence?00:04:52	SN	Like it.00:04:53	T	Huh?00:05:07	T	You did good yesterday, Antwone. All right. Now, let me ask you another question.00:05:14	T	Suppose we dig down further into the sedimentary rock, into a layer that's underneath it.00:05:23	T	Maybe- maybe this fossil of a fish is found in here, and maybe something like this-00:05:37	T	is found below it.00:05:39	SN	What is that?00:05:40	T	Well, it's called a brachiopod. And to us it looks like a clam. It's a shelled animal. If you had this fossil and you found it over here,00:05:58	T	which would you say is older?00:06:01	SN	The one at the bottom.00:06:03	T	Which would you say is older?00:06:05	SN	Um-00:06:08	T	What would you say, Aisha- Angela?00:06:11	SN	I'd say the one (inaudible).00:06:12	T	This one is older?00:06:13	S	No, //the other one00:06:14	SN	//No. The bottom one.00:06:15	T	Why is the bottom older?00:06:16	SN	Because it's more down.00:06:18	T	That's right.00:06:21	T	So I- so obviously the- the strata or the layers on the bottom are older than the ones on the top.00:06:29	T	Now, you could use this.00:06:30	T	This is how geologists go about figuring out what animal came first and what animal came second and what animal came third.00:06:40	T	So it's almost like looking back in a book, where the pages at the bottom contain fossils that are older than the pages on the top.00:06:54	T	All right. Now, let me show you something. Let me shut this. Corey, you want to get the lights for a minute?00:07:06	T	Don't laugh.00:07:07	SN	Oh.00:07:09	T	Sonia, I told you not to laugh. Oh.00:07:14	SN	I love your pants. Loving it.00:07:20	T	All right. Any idea where I am?00:07:23	SN	It's-00:07:24	T	Any idea?00:07:27	SN	Yeah, um-00:07:32	T	Well, I don't mean the exact- I can tell you the exact location, but the type of landscape I'm on.00:07:39	SN	Ice.00:07:40	T	No. It's not ice, Samuel.00:07:42	SN	It's a-00:07:45	T	Sonia?00:07:46	SN	Is it a mountain?00:07:47	T	It's a kind of mountain.00:07:49	S	A cliff?00:07:50	T	I don't know if you can call it a cliff.00:07:53	SN	It's a rock.00:07:55	T	I'm standing on rock.00:08:04	T	Sonia, got a clue here?00:08:09	T	Delia. I'm sorry.00:08:12	SN	No.00:08:15	T	Yolanda?00:08:16	SN	Maybe you're standing on a rock, and the sediments in the middle are eroding.00:08:22	T	No. That's not how this hole got here. All right. Rudy?00:08:31	SN	A river went in the (inaudible), and it dried out.00:08:35	T	Let me tell you where it was, all right? This is in an island-00:08:42	SS	Hawaii.00:08:45	T	Does that help? The island of Hawaii.00:08:47	SN	Oh.00:08:48	T	Hawaiian islands-00:08:49	SN	I got it.00:08:50	T	There's many islands. The biggest one is- is Hawaii. The one that has the- the capital, Oahu- or Honolulu is on the island of Oahu.00:08:59	T	But there's something about the Hawaiian islands.00:09:03	SN	Me.00:09:04	T	What is that? What was that? //Jeffrey?00:09:06	SN	//They're all volcanoes.00:09:07	SN	They're volcanoes.00:09:08	T	That's right.00:09:09	SN	You're on a volcano.00:09:11	SN	Volcano?00:09:12	T	So I'm standing on a vol- near the top of a volcano. Now, if I'm standing on the top of a volcano,00:09:24	T	Why am I not standing on sedimentary rock?00:09:33	T	Why do I have to be standing on another kind of rock that we're gonna call non-sedimentary at least for the time being? Why? Paola?00:09:43	SN	Because the lava was probably (running or so)-00:09:45	T	Can't hear.00:09:46	S	Because it was probably hot, the rock or the lava was running or something.00:09:51	T	Well, you're getting close.00:09:52	SN	Moist, or-00:09:54	T	You're getting close. What is it? What do you say, Carl?00:09:59	SN	Because of the (inaudible) going into the hole, it could probably break off.00:10:05	T	No.00:10:07	T	Wait a minute. We just got through saying not 10 minutes ago that if sediments get deposited in some sea and they get buried deep enough-00:10:21	T	they may be pressed into sedimentary rock.00:10:26	T	Now, I'm not standing on sediments, and I'm not standing on sedimentary rock. What kind of rock am I standing on?00:10:36	SN	Mountain.00:10:37	T	What is that- what do you say there, uh, Kyra- uh-00:10:43	SN	Kyra.00:10:44	SN	Kyra.00:10:45	T	Kyra.00:10:46	SN	You're standing on non-sedimentary rock.00:10:47	T	Yeah, but how is it different than sedimentary rock? Think the way this rock- this rock forms.00:10:58	T	How did it form?00:10:59	SN	Because, um-00:11:00	T	How did it form, Terrence? How does it form, Samuel?00:11:04	SN	By heat.00:11:05	SN	Heat.00:11:10	T	Heat is necessary. Sonia?00:11:13	SN	Is it metamorphic rock?00:11:17	SN	Magma.00:11:18	T	What comes out of a volcano?00:11:21	SS	Lava.00:11:22	T	Okay. //Now,00:11:23	SN	//(inaudible) magma.00:11:24	T	we can call it lava if it comes to the surface.00:11:28	T	Some lava never comes to the surface. We can't call it lava; we have to call it magma.00:11:35	T	Once you say magma, you include the magma that comes to the surface that we call lava,00:11:41	T	or magma that never makes it to the surface, stays underground. Now, look at your charts.00:11:50	T	What has to happen to magma, or in other words, molten rock- that's where the heat comes in- in order for it to become solid? Think about it.00:12:02	SN	It has to cool.00:12:03	T	That's right. So if magma cools, it becomes solid, much the same way that when water cools it becomes ice.00:12:15	T	And what kind of rock is this non-sedimentary rock? It doesn't come from sediments. What is it, Terrence?00:12:24	SN	It's igneous rock.00:12:26	T	Very good. So there's another type of rock. Now, look at this. Let me lower the screen a minute.00:12:39	T	So I- I went down the slope of the volcano, I walked about four or five miles, and I came to this sign.00:13:02	T	So I'm giving away my age. What does it say there?00:13:10	SN	September 1974-00:13:11	T	Sheba, what does it say? I know if you can see it, the rest of us can see it.00:13:14	SN	"September 1974 Lava Flow."00:13:17	T	Okay. What kind of rock do you think this is?00:13:23	SN	Igneous.00:13:24	T	What kind of rock, Antwone?00:13:26	SN	Magma.00:13:27	T	Huh?00:13:28	S	Magma. Lava.00:13:29	T	You're right. Lava is magma, but this long since cooled down. This isn't hot anymore. It became solidified. What kind of rock?00:13:41	SN	Igneous.00:13:42	T	Okay. So let's put that one on the board. If you had to- if you had to describe how igneous rock is formed, how could you say it in one sentence?00:14:03	T	One sentence.00:14:10	T	One sentence.00:14:12	SN	Cold lava.00:14:13	T	What would you say, Terrence? One sentence.00:14:24	SN	I don't know.00:14:27	T	It's on the chart right in front of you.00:14:42	T	You see it?00:14:43	SN	Yeah.00:14:44	T	All right. How does igneous rock form?00:14:52	T	How does it form, Kyra?00:14:55	SN	Igneous rock is formed when magma cools.00:14:57	T	Can't hear.00:14:58	S	Igneous rock is formed when magma cools, (magma).00:15:09	T	Now, when magma cools, what happens to the state of matter that it's in? There's a change in state of matter?00:15:16	SN	Yeah.00:15:17	T	Yeah. So what's the change, Rudy?00:15:18	SS	Solid.00:15:19	SN	From liquid to solid.00:15:20	T	Okay. So it becomes solid so we could say it solidifies.00:15:29	T	There you go. All right. Now, look at this.00:15:36	T	What evidence is there that this is igneous rock? Look at- look at the surface. Look at the surface.00:15:52	T	Look at the surface.00:16:00	T	Touch it.00:16:01	SN	How come you don't want to touch it?00:16:02	T	It's not hot anymore.00:16:08	T	All right. Anyone see any evidence? Remember, it was once liquid.00:16:16	SN	Oh, oh, oh, I know.00:16:17	T	What do you see there? What do you see, Terrence?00:16:21	SN	It's like- the little holes inside of it.00:16:24	T	Well, you're right. What do you think the little holes are from?00:16:27	SS	Bubbles. Bubbles.00:16:29	T	What kind of bubbles?00:16:30	SN	Magma bubbles or lava bubbles.00:16:32	SN	Oxygen.00:16:33	T	Well, what makes bubbles?00:16:35	SS	Heat.00:16:36	SN	Air.00:16:37	SN	Liquid.00:16:38	SN	Air.00:16:39	T	Air. Some kind of gas.00:16:41	T	So when this magma came up through the volcano in Hawaii, the magma that it contained had a lot of gas in it.00:16:53	T	I guess it was something like club soda, has bubbles in it. So when the rock cooled and solidified-00:16:59	SN	The holes-00:17:00	T	The holes- yeah. The holes became preserved. All right? Now, take a look at your chart. I want to show you something.00:17:09	T	Right under the rock cycle chart is a scheme for igneous rock identification.00:17:20	T	Now, you see where it says vesicular?00:17:23	SN	Mm-hm.00:17:24	T	You see? Look where I'm pointing.00:17:25	SN	Yeah.00:17:26	T	Vesicular means gas bubbles. So what I'm holding is vesicular basalt, all right? Gas bubbles. You could write it right on your chart.00:17:40	T	All right? Now, I want to show you something else.00:17:45	T	All right. I'm gonna pass back two igneous rocks. In a way they're almost the same, and in another way they're different.00:17:56	SN	It's hot.00:17:57	T	Well, that's because it was near the projector. All right. I just want you to look at it and then pass it back.00:18:03	T	You can touch it, but pass it back, because one of these is a fairly rare rock, and I don't have enough for everybody.00:18:12	T	Pass it.00:18:14	SN	(inaudible) pass it.00:18:15	T	Okay. I'm gonna give one to Antwone.00:18:22	T	All right. Now, take a look at this.00:18:26	T	Now, I'll tell you up front that you're looking at igneous rock, two different samples. Now, if I- if it's igneous rock, where did it come from?00:18:42	SN	Lava.00:18:43	SN	Lava.00:18:44	T	All right. Well, yeah. Don't call it mag- don't call it lava. Let's call it magma.00:18:49	SN	Magma.00:18:50	T	Okay?00:18:53	T	Now, let me tell you a little story.00:19:02	T	Here's a cross-section of some part of the crust of the earth. Now, what do you think these horizontal layers are?00:19:15	SN	Bricks.00:19:16	T	What kind of rock?00:19:17	S	Bricks.00:19:19	SN	Limestone.00:19:20	T	What kind of rock?00:19:21	S	Bricks.00:19:22	T	What kind of rock comes in layers?00:19:24	SN	Sediments.00:19:25	T	Yeah. All right? So these are different types of sedimentary rock, the layers. Oldest is on the bottom.00:19:32	T	Now, what does it say- what does it say here, Kyra? If you can see it, everybody can.00:19:39	SN	Magma source.00:19:40	SN	Magma source.00:19:41	T	Okay. So at one time this was molten. What happened to at least some of the magma? Look.00:19:51	SN	It went up.00:19:52	T	Well, what happened? What happened, Corey?00:19:54	S	It went up.00:19:55	T	That's right. And what we say is it intruded into the rock that was already there, so we call this an igneous intrusion.00:20:07	T	Sort of intruded into the rock that was already there. Now, let's follow this intrusion. Where did this intrusion wind up?00:20:18	SS	On the surface.00:20:19	T	Ah. Okay. Now, that could be a kind of volcano that they have in Hawaii- they're called shield volcanoes-00:20:27	T	because the magma is very liquidy and loose, so it spreads out.00:20:32	T	Now, why would this magma that came out at the surface cool faster than the magma, let's say, that never made it to the surface?00:20:45	SN	(inaudible)00:20:46	T	I mean, there's a lot. I'm just using this as an example. Cools slowly. Why? Why is that, Delia?00:20:54	SN	Because maybe the air made it cool faster, that's on the surface.00:20:57	T	That's exactly right. As a matter of fact, some magma cools even quicker. There's magma- there are volcanoes under water,00:21:05	T	and the magma comes up and freezes much quicker than it does in the air. But, anyway, how many people have ever made rock candy?00:21:16	SN	Me.00:21:17	T	All right. The longer you let that string hang in the water, what about the size of the crystal? Did you make it that way?00:21:28	SN	No, never-00:21:29	T	All right. Let me show you something. Magma is a liquid, and in the liquid you have charged atoms.00:21:39	T	In the seventh grade, you learned that atoms when they become charged, when they become dissolved,00:21:48	T	when they became liquid form- when the state of matter changes, they become ions.00:21:53	T	Now, since this is magma and it's a liquid, the atoms can move around. What do you think's gonna be attracted by a positively charged ion?00:22:04	SN	//Heat.00:22:05	SN	//Elec-00:22:06	SN	Heat.00:22:07	T	Huh?00:22:08	SN	Electricity.00:22:09	SN	Heat.00:22:11	T	Why?00:22:12	SN	(inaudible).00:22:13	T	Right. So given enough time, positive atoms- positive ions attract negative ions and negatively charged atoms, and they'll-00:22:26	T	they'll line up due to electrical charges. Given enough time, they arrange themselves very orderly, and you might wind up with something like this.00:22:44	SN	That's cute.00:22:46	T	What is it?00:22:47	S	A crystal.00:22:48	SN	It's a crystal.00:22:49	T	It's a cry- That's all a crystal is. It's an orderly arrangement of atoms,00:22:51	T	and the atoms align- aligned themselves when the magma was liquid, when it was in a liquid state.00:22:59	T	So the longer the magma stays liquid, what can you say about the size of the crystal?00:23:05	SN	It gets bigger.00:23:06	T	It gets bigger. Okay. But suppose the magma comes out at the surface and cools real quick.00:23:15	T	What's gonna happen to the charged atoms? Will they have a chance to line up and become-00:23:22	SS	No.00:23:23	T	All right. Now, remember the rocks I passed back.00:23:29	T	There was one that had big crystals, and there was one that had small crystals. Who has the rock now?00:23:38	T	All right. Do me a favor, Shevaun. Hold up the one that you see has big crystals.00:23:48	T	Okay. And how do you know it has big crystals?00:23:51	SN	Because it's kind of sparkly (inaudible).00:23:55	T	Yeah. Here it is. Well, here it is. I put this down on my floor.00:24:00	SN	Marble.00:24:01	T	No, it's not- you can see //the-00:24:03	SN	//Granite.00:24:04	T	That's right. It's granite.00:24:07	T	All right? So this- this, that cooled under ground, the crystals had time to line up, the magma took a long time,00:24:16	T	because it cooled very slowly, so you get large crystals.00:24:26	T	But where the magma- but where the magma comes out at the surface,00:24:32	T	atoms don't- and magma freezes really quickly, atoms don't have time to line up, you get small crystals.00:24:42	T	Okay? Now who else has the rock now?00:24:45	T	Okay, Antigua, hold up the rock that cooled quickly.00:24:52	T	Hold it up. How do you know that cooled quickly?00:24:55	SN	Because it doesn't have a lot of crystals.00:24:58	T	Can you see the crystals?00:24:59	S	No.00:25:00	T	Can you see little specks in there?00:25:04	S	Yeah.00:25:05	T	Those may be those tiny crystals, all right? Now, one more thing. If you're wondering how I'm naming these rocks, it's all on the chart.00:25:17	T	First of all, is the rock that you are holding- is it light colored or dark colored?00:25:26	SS	Light colored.00:25:27	T	Light colored. Okay. Now, notice on your chart it says color: light. So these rocks over here are all light in color.00:25:40	T	Now, according to the chart, what the- what's the color of these igneous rocks?00:25:46	SN	Dark.00:25:47	T	Yeah. It says "dark." So since they're light in color, I know and you should know that it could be granite or rhyolites,00:25:59	T	or even a rock called the pegmatite. Now, look over here where it says grain size.00:26:09	T	That's a way of describing the crystal size. You might want to write "crystals" here.00:26:18	T	All right? Which of these- which of these word- which of these correspond to something that has a fine grain or tiny crystals? Look at the measurements.00:26:29	SN	Less than-00:26:30	T	Okay. Less than one millimeter or less than a tenth of a centimeter, light colored. That rock is rhyolites.00:26:42	T	But if it has bigger crystals, let's say a tenth or one millimeter to a centimeter big-00:26:50	SN	It's granite.00:26:51	T	That's right. Then it's granite. So it's really very simple.00:26:58	T	Now, if the rock took a real long time to cool, if it's one centimeter or 10 millimeters or larger, then it's called pegmatites.00:27:14	T	Let me see. Here's the pegmatite. Look how big those crystals are. There's one crystal right here. It's feldspar. All right?00:27:29	T	So this one took a real long time to cool. The crystals are really big. We say it has a very big grain size. Okay. Let's wrap this up.00:27:44	T	How do you know by looking at an igneous rock, where the rock cooled?00:27:49	T	Where the magma cooled? What's the general rule, Yolanda?00:27:55	SN	Maybe because it has a different type of rock in it.00:27:59	T	Look at the rock. How do you know that the magma that formed an igneous rock cooled underground? How do you know, Rudy?00:28:08	SN	Probably because of the size of the crystals.00:28:09	T	Okay. So as the magma cools underground- Rudy, what did you say?00:28:16	S	The size of the crystal.00:28:18	T	Well, tell us about the size.00:28:20	S	//The size- the size of the-00:28:21	T	//Big? Little?00:28:22	S	Big.00:28:23	T	Okay.00:28:27	T	And on the other hand, if the magma came out at the surface maybe through a volcano-00:28:41	SN	Smaller.00:28:42	T	Then what's gonna be the size of the crystal? What, Terrence?00:28:48	S	Small.00:28:49	T	Okay.00:28:56	T	All right. Now, listen to this question. Here's another igneous rock.00:29:11	T	You see any crystals in here, Eric?00:29:13	SN	No.00:29:14	T	Okay. Tiny crystals. What's the name of this rock? Look at your chart. Look at your chart.00:29:24	T	Here. I got one that was transported by a stream. What's- very ti- well, it's round.00:29:32	SN	Oh, my gosh.00:29:33	T	It's really heavy.00:29:35	SN	Yeah.00:29:37	T	What's the name of it, Shevaun?00:29:39	SN	Basalt.00:29:40	T	Very good. How did you get basalt?00:29:43	SN	Since Eric said it was tiny in crystal.00:29:46	T	Okay.00:29:47	S	I looked at "less than one millimeter."00:29:49	T	Very good.00:29:50	S	And I looked at the dark side.00:29:51	T	Ah. (inaudible) dark. Basalt: small, tiny crystals, dark in color, and- look- here are the minerals that make up the rock.00:30:07	T	Here are the minerals that make up granite and rhyolite.00:30:12	T	Why do you think granite and rhyolite are light in color? What does that tell you about the minerals- the color of the minerals that make it up?00:30:20	SN	It has to be-00:30:21	T	What?00:30:22	SN	It has to be a light color.00:30:23	T	Yeah. And look: quartz, clear to white; feldspar, pink to white.00:30:31	T	So the rock is white- light colored, because the minerals that make up the rock are light.00:30:38	T	But on the other hand, different parts of the world have different magmas. It's like soup.00:30:46	T	So this soup, or this magma, contained dark ones. Here's a dark green. All right? Here's a little bit of black.00:30:56	T	So now you know how to name the igneous rocks. Now, suppose you had an igneous rock that cooled so quickly no crystals had time to form.00:31:06	T	What's the name of that rock? I can't pass this around because it happens to be very, very sharp.00:31:15	SN	Ballistic glass.00:31:17	T	That's right. It's glass.00:31:24	T	If you ever wondered how did the cavemen shave- how do you- how do you- how did they shave before they had-00:31:31	SN	With rocks.00:31:32	SN	With basaltic-00:31:33	SN	With rocks.00:31:34	T	This. If you hit it the right way, it flakes off, and you get something as sharp as a razor blade, even sharper than a razor blade,00:31:44	T	and that's how they shaved.00:31:48	T	No, really, //if00:31:49	SN	//Was it like that?00:31:50	SN	//No.00:31:51	T	//I mean- that's how they shaved, and another thing is, this is- this is one of the items that Indians used as arrowheads and knives.00:31:58	SN	Yeah.00:31:59	T	All right? Now, here. How did you know that, Shevaun?00:32:03	SN	What?00:32:05	T	Where does it say that?00:32:07	SN	Right here-00:32:08	SN	It's at the top.00:32:09	T	Okay.00:32:10	SN	It's ballistic glass.00:32:12	T	No crystals. No crystals tells you something about how fast the magma cooled.00:32:19	SN	It cooled real fast.00:32:20	T	Right. So in this case there's magma that cooled so quickly no ions have time to line up,00:32:29	T	and you get obsidian if it contains these minerals or basaltic glass if it contains the darker ones.00:32:41	T	All right? Now, I sometimes do this. How did- how did the cavemen-00:32:46	T	or how did the American Indians, people that- or before they invented- discovered metal, how did they flake these?00:32:55	T	How do you make a tool out of this?00:32:57	SN	Scrape it against another rock.00:32:58	T	No. They didn't do that.00:33:02	T	They didn't do that. And they made some very fine tools out of this.00:33:10	T	I think the Egyptians used this as scalpels. They did operations. So did the Indians in South America. They did operations.00:33:18	T	They didn't have knives- well, they had knives, but how do you fashion this into a sharp-edged tool? How, Sonia?00:33:26	SN	They could take it and they (chopped) it on the ground or something.00:33:35	S	Take a (inaudible) the same thing.00:33:36	T	All right.00:33:37	SN	I see, you have to take a-00:33:38	T	I'm not gonna do it; I'm afraid it's gonna fly off and hit somebody, but if you hit it just the right way-00:33:43	T	they used their hands and another tool to bang it on. If you hit it just the right way, you get these flakes that are real sharp.00:33:59	SN	Mm-hm.00:34:04	T	I think one went into my finger. I feel a little splinter.00:34:07	SN	It's right there.00:34:13	T	Clean as a whistle. It's as sharp as any razor blade.00:34:25	T	All right? How many people saw the movie Congo?00:34:30	SN	Me.00:34:31	T	Okay. I didn't see it. My son told me about it. It has to do with diamonds, right?00:34:37	SS	Yeah.00:34:38	T	All right. Delia, what about the diamonds? Where were they?00:34:42	SN	They were in some cave.00:34:44	T	How big were the diamonds?00:34:48	S	I don't remember.00:34:49	T	All right. I read an article just two days ago. They didn't use real diamonds.00:34:55	SN	Glass.00:34:56	SN	(It was fake?)00:34:57	T	They didn't use glass.00:34:58	SN	//Stones.00:34:59	SN	//Diamonds?00:35:00	T	They used a mineral that you find in granite. It's the clear one. It's called quartz.00:35:08	T	All right? Now, this crystal of quartz, is kind of rare because it's called the twin. It has a point on both sides.00:35:26	T	Not like this one that has- it's only pointed on one side. Now, as far as I know, there's only one place that has these quartz.00:35:36	T	It's called Her- it's found in the city of Herkimer, New York, and they call it a Herkimer diamond.00:35:44	T	It's not really a diamond, but it has this shape like a diamond, and that's what they used as diamonds in the movie Congo.00:35:54	T	All right? Now, I told you- we talked about Cooperstown- Cooperstown, New York.00:36:03	T	Remember Cooperstown? Remember Howe Caverns?00:36:08	SN	Yeah.00:36:09	T	Right, Howe Caverns?00:36:10	T	Well, if you go into Howe Caverns to see the limestone cave-00:36:22	T	All right? Right here. I think it's a little north of Albany.00:36:29	T	If you go a little further north- remember the Baseball Hall of Fame is here- you have the town of Herkimer00:36:38	T	and as soon as you get into the town of Herkimer you see signs, "Visit the Herkimer Diamond Mines," and that's where it is.00:36:45	T	You go to the Herkimer Diamond Mines. They rent you- Antwone, you looking for it?00:36:51	SN	Yeah.00:36:52	T	You see it? You can rent hammers, goggles, and they'll send you out into this cliff, and you can hack away at the rock,00:37:05	T	and that's how I found the- this Herkimer diamond. They're there for you- they're there for you to get.00:37:12	SN	(inaudible)00:37:13	T	Yeah. So it's- it's kind of a neat geology- neat geology trip to go to Howe Caverns, go a little further north, and find- mine Herkimer diamonds.00:37:27	T	They're very- I don't think they're found anywhere around the earth except in Herkimer, New York.00:37:35	T	All right, now let me ask you- here's a tough question.00:37:52	T	Okay. How many people saw ET? Does that look familiar?00:37:58	SS	No.00:37:59	T	That look //familiar?00:38:00	SN	//Yes.00:38:01	SN	No.00:38:02	T	This is in Yosemite National Park. It's called Devil's Tower. I believe it's in Yosemite. It's out west. Now, this is solid granite.00:38:15	T	How could you explain- since granite cools underground slowly- that's why it has big crystals-00:38:22	T	how in the world can this piece of granite be above the surface?00:38:37	T	What do you think, Paola?00:38:42	SN	Oh, um-00:38:44	T	All right. This has large crystals. It cooled slowly, it cooled underground, but yet here it is.00:38:58	T	What do you say, Eric?00:39:00	SN	I don't know.00:39:01	T	What do you say, Carl?00:39:02	SN	Huh?00:39:04	T	What do you say, Corey?00:39:08	SN	I don't know.00:39:09	T	Kyra?00:39:10	SN	There is probably more (than one layer of it).00:39:11	T	No. Samuel?00:39:13	SN	Maybe- since it's underground, maybe it was pushing up on the surface, and the surface just probably cracked, and it just came up.00:39:21	T	Oh. You mean- what are you saying? It really did cool underground?00:39:25	SN	Yeah.00:39:26	T	All right. So if it cooled underground, that would account for the large crystals.00:39:36	T	But you see it now above ground- so what do you say, Yolanda?00:39:42	SN	Maybe it cracked the ground, and it came- and it just kept rising.00:39:47	T	So you mean something pushed it up?00:39:50	SS	Yeah.00:39:51	T	Okay. That's very good.00:39:56	T	Almost.00:39:59	T	It was pushed up, but at one time it was an intrusion, and there was rock around it.00:40:12	SN	And it broke off.00:40:14	T	What happened to the rock around it?00:40:17	T	Or what could have happened to the rock around it? And think back to Niagara Falls.00:40:25	T	Carl?00:40:26	SN	Because (inaudible).00:40:29	SN	Water went over it, and it pushed up.00:40:32	T	It might have been water, what?00:40:34	SN	The thing that rubbed against it.00:40:36	T	What wore away?00:40:37	SS	The rock.00:40:38	SN	The rock.00:40:39	T	The s- why?00:40:40	SN	Because they were soft.00:40:41	T	Very good. It must have been softer. Okay.00:40:45	SN	That was a good lesson.00:40:46	T	Thank you. Yeah. All right.Ê               Bottom of Form
