Here's how it works.00:31:56	O	When your brain sends a signal to the heart to beat, the right atrium fills with used blood that has been through the body00:32:00	O	and needs to go to the lungs for more oxygen.00:32:03	O	The left atrium fills with fresh blood from the lungs that is ready to got back through the body.00:32:07	O	The atria squeeze blood into the ventricles below.00:32:10	O	When all of the blood is in a ventricle, the valve between the ventricle and atrium closes and the ventricle pushes the blood out of the heart.00:32:17	O	The right ventricle pumps used blood to the lungs. The left ventricle pumps fresh blood into your body so it can circulate.00:32:23	T	Did you see how it does it simultaneously?00:32:24	SN	That's so cool.00:32:26	T	Isn't it.00:32:27	O	The right ventricle pumps used //blood to the lungs.00:32:28	T	//Sorry.00:32:30	SN	//Stop.00:32:31	O	//into your body so it can circulate.00:32:34	O	It takes about one minute for blood to circulate through your entire body and back and to your heart to be pumped out again.00:32:38	SN	What's he doing?00:32:39	SN	He's writing without any hands.00:32:41	O	So now we know how your heart beats.00:32:42	SN	He's writing to the girl about what he's doing.00:32:43	T	Shh. Shh.00:32:45	O	The process of pumping blood is one that your body does automatically over and over again //no matter what you're doing.00:32:49	T	//Listen, you guys. Shh.00:32:52	O	Right. Lana asked about feeling her heart beat during sports. Your heart rate increases when you run and play and even when you're nervous.00:32:58	O	Think about it. When your bodies working hard, the muscles tire out quicker.00:33:02	O	Your heart needs to beat faster to get oxygen through your body so that you can keep going.00:33:06	O	The faster and harder your heart is beating, the louder it sounds. Well I hope that answers your question Lana.00:33:14	O	Another one.00:33:16	SN	Dear Tim. You are nice and I like you.00:33:21	O	Ah.00:33:22	T	That's the robot.00:33:24	SS	(inaudible)00:33:27	SN	Let's take the quiz.00:33:28	T	We'll take it later.00:33:29	S	No. Now.00:33:30	T	No.00:33:32	SN	Now.00:33:34	SN	Settle down.00:33:35	T	Okay check this out. This is blood pumping through your heart. This is just a diagram of course.00:33:40	T	Okay, so you can see, you can see right here this is blood that's coming from the body.00:33:47	T	This is called the inferior vena cava.00:33:49	T	And this is the superior vena cava and this comes from- this pumps blood from your head and your shoulders00:33:57	T	and this pumps blood from your body and it goes into your right atrium and then it goes down into the right ventricle, RV.00:34:10	T	Then it goes out the pulmonary artery to the lungs and gets fuel.00:34:22	T	Then it comes in the pulmonary vein to the LA, //left atrium.00:34:29	SN	//Oh... that's why you did that.00:34:31	T	Then it goes to the left ventricle, then it goes out the aorta.00:34:36	T	These three arteries carry it up to the head, and these- //this00:34:40	SN	//And that's //why they were blue and red.00:34:41	T	//artery carries it down to the bottom all over the body.00:34:45	SN	They look like arms going like this.00:34:47	SN	That was your story.00:34:48	SN	Miss Dupont, you're really smart.00:34:50	T	No you //are.00:34:51	SN	//And that's why it was red and blue.00:34:53	T	Okay this is blue because it doesn't have oxygen in it and this is red because it does.00:34:59	T	Now, let me ask you something, what's the difference between an artery-00:35:02	T	Now, vein is not up here, but what's the difference between an artery and a vein?00:35:07	T	It all has to do with coming and going to the heart. Lester.00:35:10	SN	I think an artery doesn't pump blood.00:35:13	T	Okay that is- we're- we're going in the right direction. Give me more pieces of the puzzle.00:35:17	T	Kathryn.00:35:18	SN	Okay, I think the artery has blood that goes in to the heart, and then the veins are blood that comes out of the heart.00:35:25	T	Okay, we're getting closer and closer, you're exactly on the right track.00:35:29	SN	Are our veins blue because they don't have oxygen in them yet?00:35:31	T	Partly.00:35:35	SN	(inaudible)00:35:36	T	Wait, wait, time out listen. Nicola, go ahead.00:35:38	SN	Arteries take the blood (inaudible) body, and the veins bring it back into your heart.00:35:42	T	Okay, so anytime blood is leaving, bye-bye, the heart it does it with an artery.00:35:50	T	Check this out- and every time it goes into the heart we call it a vein.00:35:57	SS	Oh.00:35:58	SN	Wow.00:35:59	T	So veins carry blood back to the heart and an artery takes it away bye-bye, okay question, comment?00:36:07	SN	How is it when you cut yourself, but you don't like cut- cut your like, vein or anything why is it- how do you bleed?00:36:15	S	If your veins, if your veins like- say you just like barely cut your hand like this?00:36:22	T	Yeah.00:36:23	S	Why do you bleed?00:36:24	T	Why do you bleed?00:36:25	S	Because it- but it's not touching your veins or arteries.00:36:28	T	Okay great question and this goes back to Bill Nye yesterday.00:36:31	T	Not only do we have arty- artery and veins, but what's the bridge in between those two things?00:36:35	SN	Tissue.00:36:36	SN	Muscles.00:36:37	T	Okay, tissue but something- I'm thinking //a very small little blood vessel?00:36:39	SN	//Ligaments.00:36:42	SS	Capillaries.00:36:43	T	Capillaries. Remember there's- I think Bill Nye said this yesterday.00:36:47	T	Each cell is only about four cells away, three to four cells away from a capillary.00:36:53	T	So that means that they're all really close to capillaries.00:36:56	SN	Oh, so-00:36:57	T	Because if your body didn't have access to that blood, Ken, what couldn't it get that it needs?00:37:01	SS	Oxygen.00:37:02	T	Oxygen that's right.00:37:05	T	Question?00:37:06	SN	What come- does the uh- does the- like the pump that reloads like-00:37:12	T	the blood in the heart to be pumped back out, is that the soft like (inaudible)?00:37:18	T	It's the- the valves. The valves are opening and closing and that's what causes the lub dub.00:37:24	SN	Lub dub.00:37:26	T	Hannah then Jonas.00:37:28	SN	Does the blood //heal your cuts-00:37:29	T	//Thank you.00:37:31	S	when you get cut.00:37:32	T	Does the blood- okay. What happens when you- what happens eventually when you bleed when you get a cut? What happens?00:37:39	SN	It clots over and then it forms a scab.00:37:41	T	What helps it to clot, Steve?00:37:43	SN	Platelets.00:37:44	T	The platelets, platelets help it to clot.00:37:46	SN	I read that in my (inaudible)00:37:47	SN	But if you have really thin- That's why people that have really thin blood, if they get a little cut, they can bleed to death.00:37:53	T	Yeah like hemophiliacs, a lack of clotting factor, blood disorder.00:37:57	T	Jonas, you're next, go ahead.00:37:59	T	Please turn to page 492 while Jonas is asking his question or making his comment.00:38:02	SN	(inaudible)?00:38:04	SN	//Is the (inaudible) the lub is the biggest pump right?00:38:06	T	//Yes.00:38:11	T	Yes.00:38:12	S	Is that coming from the side of the heart without the oxygen or with the oxygen?00:38:18	T	It's the big push- it is from the right atrium.00:38:27	T	What's this?00:38:28	SN	(inaudible)00:38:29	T	Oh.00:38:31	T	All right, this looks complicated and it's not.00:38:35	T	This is really pretty simple but if you look at it first off, it kind of like, "whoa," it's a lot of stuff there.00:38:41	T	What you'll need to do is you're going to follow the arrows.00:38:46	T	Everybody should have their own book, 492. Everyone should have their own book, 492.00:38:54	T	All right, this is what you're going to do; we're going to trace the flow of blood. We'll start with the RA up here, the right atrium.00:39:00	T	So you're going to put your index finger on this right atrium, this white arrow. Please everybody do that now.00:39:05	T	On the right atrium. It's right here.00:39:08	SN	I know.00:39:09	T	Check with your table partner.00:39:10	T	All right.00:39:11	T	Follow the white arrows down from the right atrium RA, to the RV, which is the right ventricle up and out of the heart.00:39:21	T	Remember anytime it's leaving, it's called an artery and since it's going to the lungs, we call it pulmonary.00:39:28	T	The pulmonary artery is going to the lungs, it picks up fuel, swings back around, is carried back through the pulmonary vein.00:39:41	T	//Wait a minute-00:39:42	SS	//(inaudible)00:39:43	T	Wait- wait- wait- wait- what?00:39:44	SN	(Isn't your heart) right above your lungs though?00:39:47	T	Um, actually it's right in between.00:39:49	SN	(inaudible) //going up?00:39:50	T	//Now, hey-00:39:51	SN	(inaudible) a diagram.00:39:52	T	Oh- oh- um, yeah, I'm sorry, that's right.
