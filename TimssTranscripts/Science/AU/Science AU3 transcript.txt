Top of Form00:00:03	T	Have a seat, Al. Right, ready to start guys. Now, what we're doing today.00:00:09	T	As you can probably see, we've got kidneys around the room, so we're going to do a kidney dissection.00:00:14	T	Now we've started talking about, with this topic, we've talked about excretion.00:00:17	T	Right, so- have a seat there. What we've done, we've started talking about excretion.00:00:18	T	So first of all, we've said excretion is when wastes are removed from the body.00:00:31	T	So excretion is when wastes are removed from the body.00:00:33	T	For example, when we breathe out we get rid of some wastes- from our- from our blood.00:00:38	T	What sort of wastes do we get rid of from our- from our blood when we breathe out, Harry?00:00:41	SN	Carbon dioxide.00:00:42	T	Carbon dioxide. Okay. So one form of excretion is when we breathe out and we excrete carbon dioxide.00:00:47	T	Right another form is the kidneys and that's also involved in excretion.00:00:52	T	Right, so what waste- stand there please- what waste is removed from the blood by the kidneys?00:00:59	T	So what waste is removed by the blood from the kidneys? We talked about this last lesson. Who can remember? Harry?00:01:04	T	What's it called? It starts with u.00:01:05	S	Urea.00:01:07	T	Urea, right. Now urea is made when the body breaks down protein.00:01:11	T	If there's too much urea in the blood, it's a poison, it has to be got rid of. So that- the kidneys filter out the urea.00:01:18	T	What else do they get out of the blood? So they get urea out of the blood and they get something else out of the blood. Yeah?00:01:22	SN	Carbon dioxide.00:01:23	T	No, they don't get carbon dioxide out of the blood. What else do they get out of the blood?00:01:26	SN	Oxygen.00:01:27	T	No, they don't get oxygen out of the blood. Yep?00:01:29	SN	Water.00:01:29	T	Water, well done. Okay, so the kidneys, they filter two things out of the blood. They filter urea and they filter water.00:01:36	T	Right. When you mix the two together what do you get? can you tell me? Tony?00:01:39	SN	Urine.00:01:40	T	Urine well done. Okay, so you mix urea with u- with ah water and you end up with urine. Right.00:01:46	T	As you walked in, you should have got a sheet, but no-one did, so we'll hand these out.00:01:51	T	Can you hand those out please? Give one to everyone.00:01:54	T	Right, first of all get your homework out please.00:01:57	T	Now we want to- you had to cut out um sections of the kidneys for homework.00:02:02	T	Let's go through and label the different parts.00:02:12	SN	Sir, is that right?00:02:14	T	Yeah, that's right.00:02:23	SN	I didn't get to finish it, sir.00:02:29	T	So on your, the one you did for homework, let's just go through and label the different parts. I've already labeled them on mine.00:02:36	T	I'll just rub that writing off the board. I want you to label these on your sheet.00:02:44	T	These are the parts of the kidney we're going to look at today.00:02:47	T	Right, so first of all, up the top of the kidney, the top part and the outside of the kidney is called the cortex.00:02:55	T	So use your ruler, draw a line from the top part of the kidney, opened up from the inside and that's called the cortex.00:03:03	T	So label that on yours please.00:03:05	T	Open up the flap of the- of the- ah- fr- open the kidney up. Label the cortex. It's just the part there. So the cortex is the part here.00:03:19	T	That part there. So it's the outside of the kidneys if you like. So the outside of the kidneys is called the cortex.00:03:28	T	Next part. This part here is called the Bowman's capsule, but that's been really highly, highly magnified.00:03:35	T	So that's- it's much, much bigger there that what it is normally. Have you got a note, Karen?00:03:38	T	Okay, can you hand in the note please? So it's been really magnified.00:03:43	T	So label those two parts, the bow- the cortex and the Bowman's capsule.00:03:56	T	Next part. The really dark red part, which is involved in the filtering the blood. Yep?00:04:01	SN	I left it on the //bus.00:04:02	T	//on the bus, okay, we're just um- you'll just have to copy someone else's book for homework. Okay. Right.00:04:08	T	Medulla is this part here, the dark red part.00:04:11	T	So when you colour in that dark red part in the centre of the kidney, it's called the medulla.00:04:21	T	So the medulla is the part of the kidney involved in filtering the blood.00:04:24	T	So that filters the blood, and it filters out the urea, filters out the water.00:04:29	T	Come give me your note? Thanks, have a seat. Close the door.00:04:38	T	Right, and so I said the medulla's the part that filters out the urea and it filters out the water.00:04:41	SN	What happens if it breaks down?00:04:43	T	Okay, if it breaks down then your body builds up with too much water-00:04:47	T	And it builds up with too much urea and so you get poisoned.00:04:49	T	Okay.00:04:50	T	There's too much urea there, it's too concentrated and it starts to break down your body cells and so you die.00:04:55	T	Yep. So the medulla filters out the urea, it filters out the water and it collects here in the pelvis.00:05:02	T	So label the pelvis, p-e-v, p-e-, p-e-l-v-i-s.00:05:08	T	And it collects in the pelvis. And once it's collected in the pelvis it runs down to the bladder- just move this across-00:05:16	T	It runs down to the bladder in a tube called the ureter.00:05:21	T	Okay, in a tube called a ureter.00:05:23	T	Okay, so, it gets filtered out in the medulla, it collects in the pelvis and it goes down the ureter, a tube down to the bladder.00:05:31	T	So label the bladder, which is down there. There's your bladder.00:05:34	T	Yep.00:05:37	SN	Sir.00:05:38	S	We didn't get that on the sheet.00:05:39	T	Okay, I'll have to give you the sheet, and you'll have to catch it up. Okay.00:05:44	T	But just watch for the moment- just so- just learn the parts yourself.00:05:47	T	You'll have to catch it up later, but this is important to understand this for the dissection.00:05:51	T	Okay. Understand the different parts. Because you're going to find these different parts on your kidney. All right.00:05:54	S	Do we get one each?00:05:55	T	No, one per group. Right, so here's your bladder. Last part is your urethra.00:06:01	T	And that's the part that goes from the bladder to the outside. Okay.00:06:05	T	So the urethra is a tube going from the bladder to the outside. Yeah, John.00:06:11	SN	What type of kidneys?00:06:12	T	Okay, we've got sheep's kidneys here, and I've also got some ox kidneys, and I'll show you those in a little while.00:06:16	S	Can I have an ox one?00:06:18	SN	Sir, what's this part here called?00:06:20	T	Ah, the ureter.00:06:36	T	All right, everybody copied that down?00:06:38	T	So what we're going to do is we're going to go through the dissection sheet with you.00:06:41	T	Then you guys are going to dissect the um, kidney. And then we're going to put the results together. What we've found.00:06:45	T	What the diff- where the different parts are, and what the different parts do. So00:06:49	SN	Sir-00:06:50	T	Yep.00:06:51	S	It's all yuk (inaudible). Isn't it supposed to be brown or something?00:06:55	T	It's all white. Um, that's right, good question. There's my big picture of the kidney. I'll just leave that up.00:07:00	SN	Is that an //ox one?00:07:01	SN	//It's because it's not (conceiving) any blood or (inaudible).00:07:03	T	(inaudible) that's the one there. All right, now you- there's some good questions.00:07:11	T	You can see the ones as you walked in, they're covered in a white material. Okay, so here is- okay, I'll fix it up in a minute.00:07:18	T	Here is two kidneys out of an ox. Now as you can see, this is how they normally come.00:07:24	T	This is what- so straight out of the animal, this is what it normally looks like.00:07:26	T	How many can tell me what you think that white material is? There you are, Al.00:07:29	SN	Fat.00:07:30	T	Fat. Okay, so both kidneys, in our bodies also, the kidneys are surrounded by fat.00:07:36	T	All right, so to protect them and also to insulate them. Yeah, Julia?00:07:39	SN	How big are our kidneys? In our body- like how big are they?00:07:43	T	How big are they? Okay, so about the same size as your fist again.00:07:46	T	So a bit- a bit s- so it's a bit smaller than the heart. So your heart's about the same size as your fist.00:07:50	T	Kidneys are a little bit smaller.00:07:53	T	All right. All right, so have your sheet out there in front of you. I'm going to go through the steps of the dissection.00:07:59	T	You're going to do a number of things. I'll just get that in the right spot there.00:08:02	T	All right, first of all, you have to remove the fat off the- off the kidneys. So you need a pair of scissors for that.00:08:15	T	So first of all remove the fat from r- the outside of the kidneys. It takes a little while.00:08:23	T	You can use the scissors, you can use a scalpel00:08:27	SN	Oh yuck. That's mad.00:08:29	SN	Does it come off easily?00:08:30	T	Yeah, the fat comes off really easily. It's probably easier just to- to pull it off.00:08:35	T	But as you pull it off, there's one thing to be careful of. There's a number of tubes coming out of the kidney.00:08:40	SN	Don't rip them out.00:08:41	T	You don't want to rip them out.00:08:42	T	So peel- peel the fat off from all around the kidney on the outside, except for around where the tubes are.00:08:47	T	And where the tubes are, use a pair of scissors or the scalpel.00:08:52	T	Now, I'll show you how to use the scalpel. Scalpels are not for using like this, Al. Scalpels aren't to be used like this, okay.00:09:01	T	The way you use a scalpel is by using it to push the- the meat away, or the fat away.00:09:06	T	So you sort of scrape it with a scalpel. That sort of cuts it as well. So you don't cut things with a scalpel like that.00:09:12	T	You cut it by scraping like that. Right, so remove all the fat. I'll- I'll be ruthless and just pull the tubes off. I got lucky.00:09:23	SN	Oh, there's the vein (inaudible).00:09:24	T	Okay so there's- you can see that there. There's the ureter. There's an artery. No, there's a vein and there's an artery.00:09:32	T	As I said, the dissection's quite simple.00:09:34	T	All you need to do guys is place the kidney on the side like this, and all you're going to do is do a cut-00:09:41	T	As you can see on the picture on your sheet there, you start cutting here, start cutting there,00:09:46	T	And you cut all the way around like this. So you can hold it here- don't want to touch.00:09:50	T	If you don't want to touch it you can use a pair of tweezers.00:09:53	SN	Do people eat kidneys?00:09:54	T	People eat kidneys, yeah. Steak and kidney pie. Steak and kidney pie.00:09:57	SN	Just like eating a (inaudible).00:10:10	T	So you see how I'm cutting it. Guys look at- look at what I'm doing please.00:10:14	T	So you start cutting from here, //right in the middle,00:10:16	SN	//How far in, sir?00:10:17	T	and you cut your way around.00:10:19	S	Sir, how far in do you go?00:10:20	T	Only a little way in. So it's quite a simple dissection. Just go all the way around.00:10:35	T	Yep.00:10:43	T	It's not that bad.00:10:45	SN	Okay, now I'm00:10:46	SS	Ohh.00:10:47	SN	Lovely.00:10:49	T	So cut it in half totally, and you need to find the different areas. Okay, so there's- there's a kidney cut in half.00:10:57	T	Let- let me show you the different areas.00:10:58	T	So, as you're doing the dissection, use the overhead to find- help find the different parts.00:11:04	T	Okay, so in the centre here, what's the one in the centre called?00:11:07	SN	Fat.00:11:08	T	What's the one in the centre called?00:11:09	S	Fat.00:11:09	T	Not fat, no.00:11:10	SN	Pelvis.00:11:11	T	Pelvis, thank you. Right, hand up for the next one, please. What's-00:11:13	SN	Um, (magnia).00:11:14	T	Shh.00:11:15	T	Right, so there's the pelvis. Next one out is called the what, Tony?00:11:16	SN	I can't read.00:11:19	SN	(Medulla.)00:11:20	T	Medulla, close enough. Medulla, right. On the way out again. Okay, Julia?00:11:24	SN	Cortex.00:11:25	T	Cortex, all right. And what's the name of this tube coming out here? The white long tube, okay00:11:30	SN	Urethra.00:11:31	T	Um, yes, Larry.00:11:33	SN	Ureter.00:11:34	T	Ureter, right. This is what you've got to do guys, three things.00:11:37	T	First of all, you've got to find those parts, and you need to put a pin in the right spot.00:11:43	T	So when you find the medulla, put a yellow pin there.00:11:46	T	When you find the cortex put a blue pin there. When you find the pelvis a red pin, and the ureter, a pink pin.00:11:54	T	So, first of all you've got to put a pin in the right spot.00:11:57	T	Second thing, you've got to label this picture, you've got to label that picture.00:12:02	T	Third thing- third and final thing you have to do is colour in the right spots. So I've got some coloured pencils here.00:12:09	T	You need to use the coloured pencils and colour in the kidney the same as your dissection.00:12:15	T	Right, now and the final instructions. First of all, all kidneys are to stay in the trays.00:12:22	T	Second of all, there's only one piece of equipment per group.00:12:26	T	So one pair of tweezers, one scalpel, one pair of scissors and one probe per group.00:12:31	T	Last instruction is that you are going to be marked on this.00:12:36	T	So you need to leave your dissections in the trays at the end, and also fill out the sheet properly.00:12:43	T	Right, um, you can begin that now. I'll come round and watch what you're doing.00:12:49	SN	Sir-00:12:49	T	Yep.00:12:50	S	(inaudible).00:12:51	T	That's okay. Have fun. You'll enjoy it.00:13:13	T	Why were you late to class? Why were you late to class?00:13:15	SN	Because I had to return the football, and Kyle and Tony were still kicking it around.00:13:19	SN	And because Tony put it in my name, I had to return it.00:13:21	T	Yeah, but you were almost ten minutes late.00:13:23	S	Yeah, Bill was later than me and he didn't even have a note. He's in the wrong uniform, got the //wrong-00:13:27	T	//All right, I'll talk to you later, okay. Talk to you later.00:13:45	T	Al, what- what was the first instruction?00:13:48	SN	Don't take 'em out of the tray.00:13:49	T	Right.00:13:49	S	I had to rip it out, (inaudible).00:13:52	SN	Sir, can I do it with Rondah's group.00:13:54	T	Yes.00:13:55	SN	Can Rondah (inaudible).00:13:58	T	Yes, for today only.00:14:00	SN	What are we doing?00:14:01	SN	I've got to rip this open and get the kidney.00:14:03	SN	I'm not ripping it open.00:14:05	SN	Sir, why is it so hard?00:14:06	T	That's the fat.00:14:08	SN	(inaudible).00:14:09	T	Yes, where is she? Yes.00:14:12	SN	I'm here.00:14:17	SN	Is that right?00:14:18	T	Yeah, that's right. Yep. So what you can do while you're waiting is get some pencils and colour it in. I haven't seen it yet.00:14:25	S	What are we supposed to colour in?00:14:26	T	Colour that- colour it the same colour as that. So when you- when you open it up-00:14:30	S	Oh, okay.00:14:32	T	Colour that in the same colour as what you see.00:14:33	SN	Gimme that pen.00:14:37	SN	Sir, what is this (inaudible).00:14:40	T	Oh careful. Use tweezers when you're using a scalpel. Otherwise you cut- cut right through. Cut your finger.00:14:44	SN	Don't worry, I'm used to cutting my finger.00:14:48	SN	Look at all the blood!00:14:50	T	Yep.00:14:51	S	Will I cut apart these (inaudible)?00:14:52	T	Use the tweezers, here you are.00:14:53	S	Yeah, but-00:14:54	SN	Use those things.00:14:56	SN	You know what I'm talking about.00:14:59	T	Be careful you don't destroy the um,00:15:01	S	Actual wires.00:15:04	T	The tubes coming off. //Wires-00:15:06	S	Wires.00:15:08	T	Keep going, you're doing well.00:15:12	T	Okay, you're doing it properly guys? Being careful? Not destroying the tube?00:15:16	T	Harold, can you tell me why you were late for class today?00:15:18	SN	Ah, because ah, I lost my diary and I was looking for it all recess, and then I- and then I went up to- I-00:15:26	S	I found it, eventually found it, and then I looked what class I had (inaudible), because I couldn't find what class I had without my diary.00:15:34	T	What happened to your diary? Who took your diary?00:15:35	S	Oh it fell out- it must have fallen out of my bag.00:15:42	T	So this has got quite a bit of fat on it, hasn't it.00:15:46	SN	Red in the pelvis.00:15:47	T	So you found the ureter.00:15:48	S	Red in the pelvis.00:15:49	T	We've found it have we. Yellow's, what yellow's medulla. Yeah, well done.00:15:53	S	Red in the pelvis.00:15:54	T	Yeah, red in the pelvis, that's right.00:15:56	SN	Blue. Blue goes on there isn't it, sir?00:15:59	T	The cortex, yeah, is that the cortex.00:16:01	S	Yeah, the outside layer.00:16:02	T	Yeah, that's right.00:16:03	S	Good, that's it.00:16:05	T	And the ureter. The ureter.00:16:07	S	That's in the that corner again-00:16:08	SN	(inaudible) flip it out.00:16:09	T	Yes, that means you have to open it up. It's one of these tubes, have to work out which one it is.00:16:15	S	I'm going to have to do some serious (inaudible). Can I rip out these things?00:16:18	T	Yep. But you've got to put them back in when you find the other one. How are we going guys?00:16:25	SN	Um, are we doing this wrong?00:16:27	T	No. It takes a while to get the fat off.00:16:30	S	Yeah.00:16:31	T	And you see three tubes coming out. The white one's the ureter.00:16:34	SN	How come it's- can we take out blue blood out of here? //Will blue blood come out?00:16:38	SN	//How about this one? How come it's all got that stringy stuff in it Mr.?00:16:41	SN	Mr.00:16:42	SN	Mr.00:16:43	SN	Mr., whatever, Mr. (inaudible). How come it's got that stringy stuff?00:16:45	T	Which stringy stuff? That clear-00:16:46	S	Yeah, that.00:16:48	T	Okay, that's connective //tissue.00:16:49	S	//Ow, Julia.00:16:50	T	It's called connective tissue.00:16:51	SN	Down-00:16:52	T	It connects organs together.00:16:53	SN	That stuff there.00:16:54	T	Yeah, it's called connective tissue.00:16:57	SN	Sir, do you cut the string?00:16:58	T	No, don't cut the string, though try and remove the fat without taking the string off.00:17:03	SN	Mr. Mann.00:17:04	T	Yep.00:17:05	S	Where is the video going to?00:17:06	T	Um, it's going to a research company, and they're going-00:17:10	S	What-00:17:11	T	Sorry?00:17:12	S	What country?00:17:13	T	Oh, in Australia I think.00:17:15	SN	I thought (inaudible).00:17:18	T	You're doing well there. It's got lots of fat on it, hasn't it.00:17:21	S	Yeah.00:17:22	T	Lots and lots and lots.00:17:23	SN	(inaudible).00:17:25	T	Year nine, yeah.00:17:26	SN	I want to stab one.00:17:28	SN	Okay, now, what colour's it got?00:17:30	T	So what have you found- what's the yellow one? Medulla. Yeah.00:17:32	SN	Blue, blue.00:17:36	T	There it is, the white tube. Yeah, what's that called.00:17:38	SN	Just watch out for my finger.00:17:42	T	What's that one called. What's00:17:43	S	That's the urethra.00:17:44	T	No, the ureter.00:17:46	S	Yeah, the ureter- I just can't pronounce it.00:17:49	T	Okay, did you find the ureter? So there should be three tubes coming off. The ureter, the artery and //the vein.00:17:54	SN	//I need a sheet.00:17:55	SN	Do you want me to cut out, //or you want to cut?00:17:56	T	//Okay, there's a sheet on my front bench.00:17:57	SN	Yeah, we're finished.00:17:58	SN	Mr. Mann, we're (inaudible).00:18:00	SN	Mr. Mann, can I go and dissect the other one?00:18:01	T	Finished? So you put the pins in the right spot. Well done, so that's- what's that called?00:18:03	SN	That's the-00:18:04	SN	Pelvis.00:18:05	SN	Pelvis.00:18:06	T	Pelvis.
