Top of Form00:00:02	T	Well you guys sure got in here in time. Beautiful.00:00:06	T	Anyway, lets agree that we're going to be ourselves no matter what. Okay?00:00:09	T	Don't let the camera bother you. Don't let the fact that I'm wearing a microphone bother you either.00:00:14	T	That would be totally unnecessary. Just be yourselves.00:00:15	O	[bell]00:00:18	T	Um, I see you guys have all of your stuff there already. I'd like you to keep your biology things shut for the moment,00:00:24	T	And that you all take a sheet in front of you. It doesn't matter whether that's a test sheet, or a scrap sheet, or a binder sheet, I don't care.00:00:31	SN	(notes)?00:00:32	T	No, no notes. A sheet and a pen. No quiz.00:00:36	SN	Can I borrow a pen?00:00:37	SN	Can I tear it in half?00:00:38	T	From one of them. Yes.00:00:41	T	Guys, the sheet is meant to take notes for yourself, but it is not subject material. You just need a sheet, that's all.00:00:49	SN	Do we have to turn it in?00:00:51	T	No, not that either.00:00:52	SN	So can we write on this?00:00:53	T	Yes, you can.00:01:00	SN	Are we getting a quiz?00:01:01	T	What do you think?00:01:02	S	(yes)?00:01:03	T	What do you think?00:01:04	S	(inaudible)00:01:04	T	What do you think?00:01:05	S	//Yes?00:01:06	SN	//We weren't supposed to study anything for today so (inaudible)-00:01:07	T	No. Exactly, exactly. Just a minor question to all. Ronald?00:01:13	SN	I just need a pen.00:01:17	T	Why don't you have a pen with you?00:01:19	SN	He never has one.00:01:20	SN	(inaudible) at home.00:01:21	T	How handy.00:01:22	T	Okay. Um. Before we start to write let's make sure if all noses are facing the right way, whom of you guys have paragr-00:01:31	T	Oh, I guess you need to open up your workbook in order to check that.00:01:33	T	Who knows by heart whether he has completed section two four?00:01:36	SN	Yes!00:01:37	SN	I completed it already.00:01:38	T	Let me ask that differently, who knows for sure that he has not completed it?00:01:43	SN	Oh oh.00:01:44	SN	We didn't have to do that yet.00:01:45	T	Okay. Thanks. No this way I know what to expect.00:01:48	T	Ladies and gentlemen, I have a question for you. I'd like to discuss a small part of section four today.00:01:55	T	If you have problems with the rest of the content of section four, than I advise you to ask those questions at the end of the hour,00:02:03	T	Or otherwise visit the "KWT". Not today though because today I have mentor hour. But you are always welcome.00:02:07	T	However today I'd like to focus on a tiny little thing from section four, and for this you'll need pen and paper in a moment.00:02:12	T	I'm going to place an overhead sheet here and then I'd like to see the hands of people who think they know-00:02:20	T	Hang on, I need to place something on this. What is it that I just put down there? Only hands, okay?00:02:27	SN	A piece of paper.00:02:29	T	That's right. That's at least one correct answer so far.00:02:31	SN	Yes?00:02:39	T	For sure you can see my name. I want, raise your hand if you think you know what this-00:02:45	T	Can you guys see this? Whatever you guys think this is.00:02:48	SN	Is that your name?00:02:49	SN	Is your name Cam Van Eik?00:02:50	T	Cam is my name, yes. C-A-M. Cam. We'll keep that one. Leo. What is this?00:03:00	SN	Well that's a card that indicates that you are a donor. That you, uh, how do you put that?00:03:05	SN	//Donor organ.00:03:06	SN	//A donor card.00:03:07	T	So this is a card that indicates I'm a donor. Shh. Who do you think possesses a card like this?00:03:17	T	Guys, that clicking with ballpoints is very irritating.00:03:21	SN	When you have registered if you are 18 years or older.00:03:25	T	Okay, okay. Jasper. Is it true that only people who are donors carry something like this, or do others carry it as well?00:03:34	SN	Do you have to carry it with you always?00:03:35	T	I am asking Jasper.00:03:36	SN	Huh?00:03:37	T	Do you know?00:03:38	S	No.00:03:39	T	You don't know? Who does know it? Maria?00:03:40	SN	Well, I'm a donor too, but I'm 12, 13 years old. When I was 12 years old I, uh-00:03:45	T	In that case you don't have this.00:03:47	S	Well, I'm not sure what kind that is exactly, for blood or something, but I was allowed to become donor at age 12.00:03:55	T	I'll return to Leo. You may finish your story in a second. Let me return to Leo for a moment.00:03:59	T	What's this thing with over 18 years old. Because it seems to me you know more about it.00:04:05	SN	Well uh-00:04:07	T	No. Oh!00:04:09	SS	[laughter]00:04:11	T	There it goes. Well it's still visible isn't it? Do you know something else, or not?00:04:15	S	Well, when you turn 18 you'll get a flyer I think and then you can decide whether you want to become a donor or not.00:04:20	T	There you go. Once you turn 18 you are a grown up person according to the law. You know you can drive a car then, that you may uh, choose? vote-00:04:27	SN	Whiskey.00:04:29	T	Whiskey? What about whiskey?00:04:30	SN	You are allowed to drink whiskey.00:04:32	T	Oh, you're also allowed to drink whiskey.00:04:34	T	Uh, you get a paper sent to your home, and then you have to fill in whether you want to become a donor, yes or no.00:04:40	T	You can see that I covered my choice with a sheet. Underneath it has my choice of what I wished to be, or rather what I want to be.00:04:49	T	That means that everybody of 18 years or older carries this card.00:04:56	T	Now I'd like you to write down--entirely for yourself, so not as a group thing, so it should be completely silent for two minutes--00:05:03	T	Now I'd like you to write down whether you know which organs we're dealing with here?00:05:09	T	It doesn't matter if you don't know it, but try to think: about which organs we are talking, when we talk about being a donor?00:05:17	T	Now two minutes of silence please.00:05:19	SN	But you can only become a donor when you're dead, right?00:05:21	T	Shh. You can ask questions in a moment. First write down whether you know to which organs this applies.00:05:40	T	It's no big deal if you don't know it, okay, Tineke?00:05:51	T	Shh. Only a minute of silence. Come on, silence!00:06:04	T	Jasper!00:06:26	T	Shh. It is only a minute, guys. Come on.00:06:44	T	Okay, 15 more seconds to go.00:07:01	T	Okay. In a while I'll check out the answers you wrote down. Now I'll let that rest for a moment.00:07:07	T	Uh, Jasper. You just told me, "This is only possible when you're dead."00:07:11	SN	Yes. You're not going to give a heart to somebody when you're still alive, are you?00:07:15	T	No, I can't imagine that. How do you picture- suppose you're a donor, how do you picture this? What do you think is going to //happen?00:07:22	S	//Well, you die and then they come to cut out all of your things, and then they give them to other people.00:07:27	T	All of your things?00:07:28	S	Well you write down on a little piece of paper that you want to become the donor of a heart or something, and then, uh- right?00:07:36	T	Okay. Who has another picture of this? Leo?00:07:38	SN	You can also be a blood donor, can't you? And that can happen while you're alive and, yeah, (inaudible)-00:07:43	T	What do you think this is about? Guys, cut it out. I'm not amused. What do you think this is about?00:07:49	S	Well, I think this is about organs.00:07:51	T	Exactly. This is about organ donation. So this is what Jasper said. When you die they'll check whether you're a donor or not and for which organs,00:08:03	T	And then they'll use your organs to heal somebody else, hopefully.00:08:08	T	When you're a blood donor though, then there's no need to indicate that because that's during your life. You're absolutely right about that.00:08:14	T	Uh, who has another image than the one Jasper just painted?00:08:17	T	Jasper said, "Once you're dead, they cut you open and take your organs out and then they place them in somebody else."00:08:22	T	Who has a different image of this? Mark?00:08:24	SN	When you have very little money then you can also sell one of your kidneys, can't you?00:08:27	T	In the Netherlands?00:08:28	S	I am not sure.00:08:29	T	Uh, these are practices that take place in certain countries, very poor countries, at least that's what you read in the paper.00:08:39	T	I'm pretty sure that doesn't happen in the Netherlands. At least let's hope so, that it's not done.00:08:44	T	You indeed have two kidneys, you've got two lungs. Uh, it's possible that you can live without one.00:08:52	T	In that sense you could sell one, but I really hope people don't actually do that, for money.00:08:56	T	Who has another image than the one that Jasper painted? Ronald?00:08:59	SN	(inaudible) but you can't simply donate a lung, can you? You couldn't put one into somebody else? Aren't there all of those blood vessels running through there?00:09:06	T	Don't you have those in a kidney?00:09:07	S	No I'm talking about a lung.00:09:08	T	Yes but is that not the case with a kidney then?00:09:11	S	Yes, but there are all kinds of blood vessels running throughout the lung tissue?00:09:15	T	Well, let's check indeed what kind of organs you guys think about when you think about organ donation.00:09:19	T	Who has written down a list of six organs?00:09:21	SN	Yes!00:09:22	T	Jasper. Tell us about it.00:09:23	SN	Heart, lungs, kidneys, liver, skin, blood.00:09:26	T	Heart, lungs- wait a minute, I'm going to write it down. Chalk. Heart. Lungs.00:09:34	S	Kidneys.00:09:35	T	Kidneys.00:09:37	S	Liver.00:09:38	T	Liver.00:09:39	S	Skin.00:09:40	T	Skin.00:09:41	S	And blood.00:09:43	T	And blood. Blood we just discussed right? That can be done while you're alive, so you don't have to use this registration for that.00:09:50	S	Also with your skin, right? In that disaster, with the fire in the bar there were also uh, there they needed big pieces of skin as well, didn't they?00:09:57	T	Skin transplants do happen, right? For people who have been badly burned. Then they can use skin.00:10:04	T	That can happen as you're alive, that they take a little skin from your leg or your buttocks to put on your face or your arm,00:10:10	T	But it can indeed also come from a- ladies! Marieke! It can also come from a dead person.00:10:16	T	Liver is after your death. Liver transplants are possible. Kidney is possible.00:10:22	T	Lungs... I don't think that's possible yet. I think that still a very complicated operation. And heart can be done.00:10:33	T	Ronald, returning to your problem. Every organ is soaked with blood vessels.00:10:39	T	So those blood vessels and nerves are always a problem.00:10:43	T	But there are organs that are easier to implant than others. For instance the kidney is a bit easier than the liver, but it can be done.00:10:50	T	Science has already progressed so far that it can be done.00:10:55	T	Uh. Okay. I'm going to get back to this a little later. I'm going to show you the other side of this card now.00:11:05	SN	Why did you put a piece of paper over that thing?00:11:08	T	That I'll tell you in a while. Since you can- you need to make a choice. The moment you get this form you have to make a choice about what you want to be.00:11:17	T	I'll read it out aloud because I don't think everybody will be able to read it.00:11:20	T	It reads, "Donor Statement. Your Donor Statement contains important and personal data about organ and tissue donation."00:11:25	T	"Would you like to change these data," blah, blah, blah. "Explanation of the data in the front page."00:11:32	T	"Option number one. You make your organs and tissues available for transplant after your death."00:11:40	T	"Option number two. You do not make your organs and tissue available for transplant after your death."00:11:47	T	"Option number three. You leave the decision to your relatives. Option number four. You leave the decision to a specific person."00:11:55	T	That could be for example your partner, child, or someone like that. This is what you need to choose from.00:12:03	T	Well I hope you realize that that choice is not a matter of putting a little circle down and ready!00:12:08	T	It's not that simple. In order to make a decision you have to think about certain things.00:12:13	T	Well, you guys are not yet 18 years old, but you heard from Maria that she has already decided to be an organ donor.00:12:20	T	That's possible. Now once again I want you guys to be silent for two minutes, perhaps slightly longer, but we're starting of with two minutes.00:12:27	T	I want you guys to come up with at least two advantages of organ donation and to write those down. Think about it carefully. Two advantages of organ donation.00:12:40	T	And I don't mean for yourself, though you may do that as well, but rather for the whole community. Two advantages.00:13:30	T	Try to come up with your own answer, guys. Because this is a choice that you are going to have to make all by yourself later on as well, and not together with others.00:13:35	T	Try to think of it now for yourself. Ifyou don't know it, then you just don't know it.00:13:40	SN	Two advantages?00:13:41	T	At least two. If you know more that's okay. At least two.00:13:48	T	If you have only one, then I want you to try very hard to think of another one.00:13:56	T	And not only for yourself, but for the entire community.00:14:23	SN	I already have three.00:14:24	SN	You can also have a blood vessel transplant, can't you, when they create a bypass or whatever?00:14:29	T	Yes that's true. Then they take a blood vessel from your upper leg, and place that close to your heart. Yes.00:14:34	T	Uh, only with donation you are talking about giving something to another person. Whereas for a bypass they use your own blood vessels.00:14:42	T	I'm not sure whether they use donors for that as well. That I don't know.00:14:46	SN	I actually find it kind of yucky.00:14:48	T	We'll talk about that in a second.00:14:58	T	I see that some people are still writing, so I'll give you a little more time.00:15:09	T	Why don't you place little scores in front of it to indicate how many you have. That makes it easier to oversee.00:15:18	T	Very nice, ladies. You've all got two.00:15:25	T	Connie?00:15:27	SN	When are we getting the subject matter for the test?00:15:30	T	Come again?00:15:32	S	When will we hear the subject matter for the test?00:15:34	T	At the end of the class hour. Isn't that how I always do it? At the end of the class hour.00:15:39	T	Okay. I think most of you are done writing. I'm sure you know what the next one is going to be. Because there are disadvantages, too.00:15:47	T	So once again two minutes of silence, if necessary. At least two disadvantages. For yourself as well as for the community.00:15:56	T	Consider it from different points of view. Jasper, alone. Try to think of two disadvantages for the fact that you are a donor.00:16:08	T	Or why you wouldn't want to be one. That's possible as well, right, also that can be considered a disadvantage.00:16:29	T	Try to do it yourself, Marieke. Later you may discuss it together but do try to think about it for yourself first.00:16:39	T	Don't you know it anymore?00:16:41	SN	No.00:16:45	T	Also try to focus on it from somebody else's perspective. If you think, "Yes, but I am in favor of this," try to put yourself in the position of somebody00:16:52	T	Who wouldn't approve. Perhaps then you can think of a disadvantage.00:16:58	T	Try to imagine somebody who would be opposed to it.00:17:46	SN	Madam, may we watch this videotape?00:17:50	T	Do you want to go through this class once more, Jasper?00:17:55	T	Let's see, I still see some people writing.00:18:14	T	Edwin.00:18:15	SN	Which were those six organs again? I'm seeing only five.00:18:17	T	Lungs were also part of it. No, we haven't gotten to that yet. We don't need to yet.00:18:23	SN	Can they do a stomach too?00:18:24	T	Stomach transplant. My goodness.00:18:26	S	And also intestines?00:18:27	T	No, intestines I don't think.00:18:31	S	You would have to find a way to catch those intestines all together.00:18:33	SN	Madam, lungs are possible. Somebody from my old class his mother had to be on an oxygen tank all the time,00:18:38	T	//And she got a lung transplant?00:18:39	S	//she got a lung transplant. Then she didn't have to do that anymore.00:18:40	T	Yes? Lung transplant, let's add that, then.00:18:44	T	Okay. Ladies and gentlemen. You have to imagine that in about four years, five years, you'll be asked to take this decision.00:18:57	T	So you don't have to decide now, you still have four or five years to go. Keeping in mind that you'll have to make that decision,00:19:05	T	I would like to see that in the group where you are seated, together- I'm not going to do this for too long, for a minute or six on that clock-00:19:13	T	I would like you to exchange the advantages and the disadvantages, and that you guys discuss these together. And see if perhaps you think once,00:19:21	T	"Oh yes, I never thought about this. Oh right, that's a good one." So talk about each other's plusses and minuses for six minutes.00:19:29	SN	You can save the lives of other people.00:19:32	SN	As well as your own life.00:19:34	SN	Oh I have that one as well.00:19:36	SN	That your own life gets saved?00:19:38	SN	Well that sure is an advantage to me.00:19:41	SN	Maybe your parents don't agree that when you're dead, your corpse is being cut into.00:19:46	T	No you should not tell that to me. But each other.00:19:47	SN	(inaudible) buried.00:19:49	SN	(inaudible)00:19:57	SN	Body parts are also used to let kids practice with them or not? Not kids but people who uh-00:20:02	T	You mean to make oneself available for scientific //purposes.00:20:03	S	//Yes.00:20:04	SN	I also have that.00:20:05	T	That's not part of this, though. That's something else.00:20:07	SN	I have, "People can do experiments with it that come in handy for transplant purposes."00:20:13	SN	In this show about crime they put down somebody's remains, just in the air.00:20:18	SN	In the air?00:20:19	SN	Well I mean just on the ground in open air and they watched how it began to rot.00:20:23	T	Everything needs to be researched, right?00:20:25	T	But please talk about each other's plusses and minuses. If you feel funny about me being here then I'll disappear.00:20:29	SN	No.00:20:30	T	All right. Then talk.00:20:31	SN	I have only two.00:20:32	S	For advantages I had: "You can help sick people, your organs didn't decompose unused, and you can make money donating blood," right?00:20:40	S	Can you make money with that?00:20:42	T	No, it's voluntary, it's voluntary. John, what did you have?00:20:47	SN	I also had, "You can save a life with it, and you can mean something to somebody after your death. When you're dead, you are not doing anything anyway."00:20:54	T	Those are your advantages, right?00:20:55	S	Yes.00:20:56	T	What advantages did you have?00:20:57	SN	I had, "You can save somebody's life, and the people can experiment with it."00:21:02	T	And now the disadvantages.00:21:04	S	It seems rancid to me.00:21:07	T	For whom?00:21:08	S	Well, I don't know, you know, //weird.00:21:10	SN	//I wouldn't want the liver of another person in me.00:21:13	SN	Well, if you're almost dying then uh-00:21:16	SN	Yes, that's true.00:21:18	SN	My grandma has only one kidney. Once, it was sick I think. They could just take it out.00:21:23	T	And then there was only one left. Does she have to undergo kidney dialysis or not? She doesn't.00:21:28	S	She swallows a lot of pills, I don't know what for, but I suppose it's just because she's a grandma.00:21:32	T	Because she's a grandma.00:21:34	S	Madam, can I put that in certain religions or whatever, if you would miss certain body parts and you need to be buried, that they don't allow that.00:21:41	T	Sure, that happens.00:21:43	S	"He's missing a stomach. He cannot be buried."00:21:46	T	I'm not sure about that, but for example the heart can be an issue, right?00:21:50	S	But some parents don't like it when their kid, uh-00:21:53	T	Talk about all this together now. That'll come up later. Just talk with each other for a while.00:21:59	SN	Yeah, you're left with less ashes.00:22:00	T	You're left with less ashes. Is that an advantage or a disadvantage?00:22:05	SN	Smaller jar.00:22:06	T	Try to discuss that which each other.00:22:09	T	How is it going here?00:22:11	SS	Good.00:22:14	T	Were there similarities in what you thought or were there differences?00:22:17	SN	There were some differences.00:22:18	T	What did you say?00:22:19	SN	There were differences but we also came to some agreements.00:22:21	T	Where was the difference?00:22:24	S	About the disadvantages.00:22:27	T	"When you don't die then there is no donor organ. Some people only think about themselves and don't become //a donor".00:22:31	SN	//That doesn't make any sense. They really don't just think about themselves.00:22:34	T	Yes, but why? What makes you think they're only thinking about themselves?00:22:40	S	Well if they don't give anything I think. But-00:22:42	T	Yes, but why are they like that? Why do you think there are people who say, "I will not donate any organs"?00:22:47	SN	They find it scary.00:22:48	T	For example. They find it scary. Is that what you have?00:22:50	SN	Yes.00:22:51	T	That's right, people find it scary. Do you have a disadvantage like that as well?00:22:54	S	Yeah, for example that you're not complete anymore.00:22:56	T	Right. There are people who find it a crazy idea, right, when you get buried-00:22:59	SN	Sometimes it's not allowed by your religion.00:23:01	T	There you go. Therefore, the way it's put here it seems very weird but one can think of many reasons why those people only think about themselves.00:23:07	T	Try to write those reasons down as well if you can. Try to form an image of it.00:23:14	SN	If brain transplants were ever possible, which person would it be? The person that the brain comes from or the person that the brain is going to.00:23:24	T	What is what? The donor?00:23:26	S	No I mean, look.00:23:27	SN	Something that's not possible at all, but never mind.00:23:29	T	No, I'm pretty sure brain transplants are impossible, but-00:23:31	SN	But I mean in case one day it's going to be possible, would the brain then- would it be the person //into whom the brain will go,00:23:36	SN	//in your case, there is not much to transplant!00:23:38	SN	Or the person that the brain is coming from.00:23:41	T	I don't quite understand your question, but if you mean that uh- the donor is the one who gives- oh, you mean personality?00:23:48	S	Yes!00:23:49	SN	That the personality gets transferred with it.00:23:50	SN	Yes.00:23:51	SN	But that's impossible.00:23:52	SN	That's impossible. I mean, if I would give my brains to you then you wouldn't be Jasper anymore.00:23:57	S	I think that's what he is talking about.00:23:58	T	I think we're talking about something that's not possible in the first place.00:24:00	SN	No. The brains: to remove all those little nerve cells, (inaudible).00:24:04	T	No, I think- that's impossible. Those brains are connected with the rest of the body by numerous nerve paths that run through the entire spinal cord.00:24:13	S	Eleven times to the moon, he says.00:24:15	T	What did you say, Mark?00:24:16	SS	(inaudible)00:24:17	SN	It's something like 11 times to the moon.00:24:18	T	(inaudible)00:24:20	SN	I think they mean 11 times to the nearest spot on the moon, or to the Aztec, but no further.00:24:28	SN	No, it's true, 11 times to the moon.00:24:29	T	But for now please don't talk about things that aren't possible. I want you to talk about what's relevant. Advantages and disadvantages, try that.00:24:36	SN	We already did that.00:24:37	T	Did you do that already?00:24:40	T	Are you guys getting it resolved?00:24:41	SS	Yes.00:24:42	T	Big differences?00:24:44	SN	No, we had more or less the same.00:24:46	T	More or less the same. Disadvantages also the same?00:24:51	S	Actually my disadvantages are a bit different than hers.00:24:55	T	I'll be back. Is it working out over here?00:24:58	SS	Yes.00:24:59	T	Many differences?00:25:00	SN	No, I have (inaudible).00:25:01	T	Not too bad. Let me see.00:25:05	T	Ladies and gentlemen. Uh, as I'm circulating here, it appears that what you say corresponds pretty well. Especially the advantages.00:25:15	T	Many of the advantages are: you can save lives. Another advantage I've seen is: when you turn ill yourself, then there's00:25:25	T	an organ available for you as well. Those are most of the advantages I'm hearing. The disadvantages differ more, and Daan said,00:25:32	T	"There are people who only think about themselves." That's a disadvantage. He considered that a disadvantage.00:25:39	T	So I asked him, "'Why would it be that people only think about themselves?"00:25:42	T	And then I asked to make a little list of that. Who of you guys knows any reasons why people would be opposed to organ donation? Ronald?00:25:54	SN	It's not so nice for the relatives to have half a corps lying there.00:25:59	T	Okay, so because they think it's unpleasant for their relatives that the body is not complete.00:26:04	S	Right.00:26:05	T	For example, that during the visit of condolence, and there is an open cast, that you can see the person has been cut. Is that what you mean?00:26:12	S	Yes.00:26:13	T	Okay, that's possible. There are people who don't do it because of the relatives, that they're afraid the relatives find it scary.00:26:18	T	Or maybe the relatives have even stated so, "I find that scary. Please don't do it." Like with removing the retina from the eye, then people think that00:26:26	T	When you view the body that the eyes will be completely gone. Well that's not the case.00:26:32	T	Let me tell you that when the organs have been removed and the body can be viewed that one doesn't notice that. You don't notice anything.00:26:40	T	But there are people who will bring this forward as a reason, and of course you have to accept every reason, right?00:26:46	T	What else can be a reason why people only think about themselves? Thinking about themselves between quotation marks. Maria.00:26:52	SN	Religion.00:26:53	T	Religion. There are people who will say from their religious point of view, "I want to knock on heavens gate in one piece."00:27:00	T	"Not with pieces cut out of me." There are people who believe in this, and you have to respect that. There are also religions that say that without00:27:08	T	Your heart you're not complete, your soul has gone. You have to respect that. Religion, okay. Any another reason? Jasper?00:27:16	SN	Some people say that when too many people stay alive then there will be too many people in the world.00:27:25	T	I see. A reason can be that when you're sick then you should just die when that's a deadly disease.00:27:29	SN	Yes. It sounds kind of tough but-00:27:30	T	And you shouldn't cure people. It could be a reason. To tell you the truth, I hope people don't think that way, but there could be people who think that way.00:27:41	T	What could be another reason why people say, "I don't want to be a donor." Tineke?00:27:46	SN	Maybe they find it scary to think that after their death somebody else will go on with their heart or whatever.00:27:52	T	Yes, the idea may simply be scary to you, exactly. It's possible, it's possible. Somebody else? Robert?00:28:01	SN	Well, the other people like your parents for example may approve that your body, uh-00:28:07	T	As soon as you are 18 years old you are the one who decides about your //body.00:28:10	S	//Sure, you decide but when your entire family or whatever, when they don't want it... that can happen, too.00:28:16	T	So because--in fact what we already said before--the relatives may find it awful.00:28:19	S	Yes.00:28:20	T	Okay.00:28:21	S	But also for yourself it can be a weird idea that you're lying there without body parts. That can also be a disadvantage.00:28:25	T	Yes, that you can find it a scary idea that you are not whole. That you've been cut.00:28:29	SN	It's not about body parts. It's about organs!00:28:31	T	Yes, organs. You're right. Organs, I agree with you, that's correct.00:28:34	SN	Lying there without a leg!00:28:35	T	Uh, we've got advantages, those are clear I suppose.00:28:42	T	The disadvantages are a little more complex, but they are definitely there.00:28:46	T	Now you have to make a choice. I'm going to give you a couple of minutes so you can share,00:28:53	T	Which doesn't necessarily mean you have to agree with each other. Let me make that clear,00:28:56	T	With each other about which choice you would make at this moment.00:29:00	T	It may change, which is no problem at all. Perhaps you think to yourself, "My opinion is different from the others."00:29:07	T	Well then so be it. But we have been discussing for 15 minutes. I'll read them out to you one more time.00:29:12	T	Choice one. You make your organs and tissues available for transplant after your death.00:29:17	T	Option two. You do not make your organs and tissues available after your death.00:29:23	T	Option three. You leave the decision to your relatives. And option four. You leave the decision to a specific person.00:29:31	T	Go ahead and decide what you would choose right now and then discuss that with each other.00:29:39	T	You were saying?00:29:40	SN	Did you say yes or no?00:29:42	T	I'm going to show you my choice later on. I leave- no otherwise you'll get influenced, "Oh, she knows a lot about it, she probably knows."00:29:50	T	No, you know a lot about it as well, and now it's time to find out.00:29:53	S	I haven't decided yet.00:29:55	T	You don't have to make the real decision yet, but whatever you would do at this moment.00:29:58	SN	But it's very different, if my mother becomes ill and needs a kidney, I would want to give it to her, but not to a complete stranger.00:30:05	S	But that is not one of the choices.00:30:09	T	But that's different than being a donor. Donor is really when you're dead, whether you make your donor organs available then. And if you would say,00:30:16	T	"I don't want to make my heart available but my liver and my kidneys are fine with me." Then that's possible.00:30:24	SN	But miss, can you still become a donor when you have been sick or unhealthy yourself?00:30:32	T	Yes. Because that doesn't necessarily mean that all of your organs are sick as well. That's possible.00:30:40	S	Yes but if you've (inaudible) have smoked?00:30:44	T	If you've had what?00:30:45	S	Smoked.00:30:46	T	If you have smoked. Then your lungs will not be of much use, but your liver might be working fine. Or your skin.00:30:55	S	But your organs may be (inaudible) useful to them. Say if they want a lung, how can they tell that they shouldn't take that lung?00:31:06	T	Well in any case they'll examine the tissue. They have to know which blood group it is, how strong it is. They'll examine all that.00:31:15	SN	Suppose later you do want to give something to your family, then isn't it a bad thing that you have said no on that sheet? Are you allowed to do it after all?00:31:23	T	Whose choice is that?00:31:25	S	Yes, but suppose ...00:31:27	T	No, whose choice is that?00:31:30	S	Well, of yourself.00:31:32	T	Yes, whose body is it? Whose body is it about?00:31:37	S	Well, your own.00:31:40	T	Yes, and the moment they ask you, "What would you choose?" then there is no such thing like one choice being right and the other being wrong. You see?00:31:47	T	It is however wise to discuss it with relatives, so they know.00:31:51	T	And you can change it. If you later change your mind, then you can change it.00:31:56	T	Sure. There is a phone number on it so that that can be arranged.00:31:59	SN	But if you're dead. Then it doesn't work anymore, does it?00:32:05	T	I'll be, I'm going to say something about this in a second, I find this a good question.00:32:07	S	Okay.00:32:08	T	Yes?00:32:09	S	Yes. That's okay.00:32:16	SN	If you have, for example, chosen four, about the specific person. So you have discussed it with that person. Imagine00:32:26	S	That you are in the car with that person and there is (an accident) Then, he can't say anything anymore either. Then what happens?00:32:30	T	The moment you get all those papers in, then you receive a form with it. Next you have to complete all that.00:32:34	T	And as proof that you have completed this, you'll get that card sent to your home.00:32:38	T	But that registration is all safely kept elsewhere and hospitals have access to that.00:32:44	T	Once they know you're a donor they will retrieve your information to see,00:32:48	T	Hey, what are we allowed to and what not, and with whom do we have to discuss it, and-00:32:51	SN	So you can also write down what you don't want to give?00:32:53	T	Yes. Suppose you say, "I don't want my heart, but they can have my liver and kidneys." Then you can register all those things.00:33:02	SS	(inaudible)00:33:09	S	I'm taking Four.00:33:11	SS	(inaudible)00:33:12	SN	A comforting thought.00:33:14	SN	Yes, if you really have (inaudible).00:33:18	SN	Four members of my family have died; my uncle, my aunt, my nephew, and my niece.00:33:23	T	Yeah, and then?00:33:24	S	What?00:33:25	T	And then?00:33:26	SN	//My aunt at age 28.00:33:27	SN	//My aunt of cancer, my grandmother of Alzheimer, my cousin (inaudible) and my other cousin (inaudible)..00:33:36	SN	Nine months, one day before.00:33:38	T	Yes but it's very sad altogether.00:33:40	SN	Yeah, but you don't need to tell that.00:33:41	T	Yes, that is sad.00:33:42	T	Ladies and gentlemen, pens down for a moment please. And all faces turned this way.00:33:49	T	Whiteout down as well. Okay.00:33:52	T	We've been thinking about this for half an hour now, and of course you do not have to make this decision as of yet.00:33:57	T	But a couple of important questions have been asked to me which I would like to pose in front of the class.00:34:02	T	For example the question has been asked, suppose you take choice four, a specific person.00:34:09	T	And together you have discussed endlessly what you do and do not want. And you're in the car together with that person, and then you die together.00:34:18	T	Then what? Well, the moment I receive that form at home I need to complete the whole thing.00:34:24	T	Then it gets sent in, and as proof that I completed it I'm receiving this card which I have to carry in my wallet.00:34:31	T	The moment I die, due to illness or old age or due to an accident, I end up in a hospital.00:34:37	T	There they'll immediately check what my registration is, whether I want to be donor, yes or no. And right away they can call up that information.00:34:44	T	That also means that if you say,00:34:46	T	"It's fine if they take my skin and my liver, but my retina, that idea doesn't appeal to me. I don't want that,"00:34:54	T	Then you have the option to write that on that paper, then they won't do that.00:34:57	T	So you can carefully register what you do and what you don't want. That's an option.00:35:03	T	Uh, a second question being asked was, how is it possible that when you're dead your organs carry on? That can't possibly be can it?00:35:10	T	Well that's in fact the only, as far as I'm concerned, unpleasant part of this story. The moment you are dead, you are declared brain dead.00:35:23	T	Your body is no longer controlled by your brain. But they keep you al- your body alive, by making the whole thing pump-00:35:32	T	So by making the heart continue to pump, the blood keeps pumping so blood keeps flowing to the organs.00:35:36	T	You're on artificial respiration so oxygen comes in. Oxygen goes into the blood so that those organs go on.00:35:42	T	They only do this because when you're an organ donor, those organs are alive until the very last moment.00:35:52	T	So that is very precarious. Equipment keeps you alive artificially, but in fact you're already dead. That's hard for relatives.00:35:59	T	And this issue will differ from person to person. There will be relatives who say, "Well, that person wants to become donor. Period. We'll do it, we'll accept this."00:36:07	T	There will also be relatives who'll find it very unpleasant that the person hooked on to the equipment appears to be alive,00:36:13	T	But the moment the equipment is turned off, he is dead. That all of this happens for the sole purpose of organ donation.00:36:21	T	But that is the most difficult part of this story for me personally.00:36:25	T	But that's how it works, Connie. It's kept alive by the equipment, and then a phone call is made, "Where is a need for an organ?"00:36:32	T	Does the blood group match? Do the blood factors match- something we also discussed before, right?00:36:36	SS	Yes.00:36:37	T	And then that organ is taken out, goes in a little box, with a trauma helicopter or whatever it'll go to the hospital where it's needed00:36:44	T	And gets placed into the sick patient, or the patient as fast as possible.00:36:50	T	Other organs they can keep stored. The skin they can keep stored so with that it's not really an issue. So that's how this is handled.00:36:59	T	We've only got a few minutes left. Are there any urgent questions? John?00:37:03	SN	Well, why is it that when you're dead that you convulse, or fart, or something like that?00:37:07	T	That's because muscles, they can be either relaxed or contracted and at the moment you die00:37:14	T	Everything begins to relax. But not all at the same time.00:37:16	T	So it could be that because of a certain movement, for example when the body gets washed that a certain relaxation takes place and then "eehh."00:37:22	T	You'll hear the corpse make a sound because those muscles start relaxing. So that's why.00:37:28	T	Ronald another? Shh, guys! Jasper! Karel! Ronald?00:37:34	SN	I don't know it anymore.00:37:35	T	Okay. Uh, I must say that you- Yes, Ronald? You remembered it?00:37:39	SN	Well, once you're lying there and you get, uh, you are connected to the equipment then you will not be buried, right?00:37:47	SN	What?00:37:48	T	But you're not getting emptied out to the extent that nothing is left of you. It's not like that.00:37:52	T	They take out a few things that are useful or that they can keep stored.00:37:56	SN	And afterwards they close //you up neatly.00:37:57	T	//they close you neatly.00:37:58	SN	But don't they have to wait until they need a donor?00:37:59	T	No.00:38:00	S	Oh.00:38:01	T	No, they won't keep you above the ground for weeks. That won't happen.00:38:04	T	Guys! We need to do a few more things in a few minutes. I feel that you have the right to know my choice.00:38:09	T	I choose option three. I am absolutely pro organ donation, as far as I'm concerned they can empty me out completely.00:38:15	T	However, through discussions I learned that my relatives have some difficulties with that.00:38:20	T	So I said, "You guys know what I want, and when I die, decide for yourselves what you can handle."00:38:28	T	So it's known that I want to get rid of everything--that everything may be taken out, that everything may be removed--00:38:33	T	But if my children would have terrible difficulty with that, like, "Geez, my mum, I can't handle this," then the choice lies- that's why the choice lies with them.00:38:41	T	But they do know that I really want to be an organ donor. Maria?00:38:46	SN	Don't you think, "It's my body, so I decide about it myself?"00:38:49	T	But they're also my children. And that's a very special feeling. So I- now, they have that right.00:38:56	T	Should you want to be a donor right now, you can get a form from me that you could complete. You have to discuss it with your parents.00:39:05	T	And then, uh, you can already carry that with you. It's just not registered. It's just a little paper that you need to carry with you at all times.00:39:11	T	If there is a need we can come back to this the next time, but right now I'm looking at the clock.00:39:16	T	We have two more appointments to make, quickly get your planners for the weekly assignment and for the central exam.00:39:44	T	Uh, the central exam is Tuesday next week? Wednesday?00:39:48	SN	Monday (inaudible).00:39:49	SN	(inaudible) Tuesday!00:39:50	T	Tuesday? Okay, Chapter Two, section one through section four.00:39:58	B	[Weekly task. 2H. December 11. 2.4 do + ch. 2.5 do. CP ch. 2. 1 thru 4]00:39:59	T	Uh, I'm not sure about the hour, I still owe //you that one.00:40:02	SN	//The third.00:40:03	T	The third hour? Thank you very much.00:40:05	SN	What day is that?00:40:09	S	Also December 11?00:40:10	T	Yes, as you can see my weekly assignment has been adapted to the central exam.00:40:15	T	[bell]00:40:17	T	I'll see you next Friday. Then you'll also have the opportunity to ask questions about the CP matter and about the organ donation.Ê               Bottom of Form
