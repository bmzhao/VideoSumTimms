Top of Form00:00:00	T	(inaudible)00:00:07	T	Okay-00:00:13	SN	Lydia! (And Lydia)00:00:16	T	Are we complete or is anyone missing?00:00:27	T	Guys, are we missing anyone? I don't think so, right?00:00:29	SS	No.00:00:41	T	Okay. Last time we did experiment A and B, boiling water. And we examined whether certain substances dissolve in certain solvents.00:00:58	T	And I'd like to discuss these experiments, like I did briefly last time at the end of the lesson. But let's get back to it for a moment.00:01:10	T	Good, the idea of doing a test is to experiment and to examine if the present theory still holds.00:01:19	T	And in case there isn't any theory yet then you could create one yourself, right?00:01:22	T	Now, determining the boiling point of water, that's not too complicated since it's well known and has been tested many times.00:01:31	T	So as far as that's concerned we're not dealing with high tech research here.00:01:34	T	But the idea is rather that you grow accustomed to using a burner again and practice with it-how to read a thermometer,00:01:43	T	Uh, and what Paracelsus said, right? What did Paracelsus say?00:01:49	SN	Me?00:01:51	T	Yes.00:01:52	SN	That you understand something by experimenting.00:01:57	T	Precisely, and so //don't reason-00:01:58	S	//And tear up your books.00:01:59	T	Tear up your books because all they contained was? What was the only thing they contained?00:02:03	S	Facts. Arguments.00:02:04	T	Arguments. Things that were made up but that were not tested by measurements. So we're just going to test them!00:02:13	T	And I already heard some say, "Yeah, but we already know that the boiling point for water is 100 degrees."00:02:17	T	Well, go ahead and measure that to see if that is indeed the result, whatever the book says. And we've seen some differences already, didn't we?00:02:23	T	Not everybody had measured 100 degrees. The reading of the thermometer was already where it started to go wrong.00:02:30	T	So that's what I'd like to address for a moment.00:02:32	SN	(inaudible) is broken.00:02:33	T	That can happen as well. If you have a boyfriend or a girlfriend who works in a job and you ask, "How much do you earn?"00:02:44	T	And, he says, "Well, I earn ten. Ten guilders."00:02:50	T	And you ask another friend who does exactly the same work and earns the same amount and the answer is, "Ten twenty-three per hour."00:02:58	SN	They don't earn the same.00:02:59	SS	No.00:03:00	SN	(They have the same job and they earn the same.)00:03:03	T	They say something different but they earn the same amount. Now what's more precise?00:03:08	SN	The one on the right.00:03:09	T	Please raise your hand if you know it... go ahead, Ronald.00:03:12	SN	The one on the right.00:03:13	T	Why?00:03:14	S	Because there are more (decimals).00:03:16	T	Exactly. The more decimals, the more precise it is. With the ten- the ten guilders,00:03:24	T	Perhaps he earns, what shall I say, ten point fifteen, but that would be rounded off to ten guilders.00:03:32	T	Or maybe he makes nine guilders ninety per hour, but if I go round that off into a whole number, then that's ten as well.00:03:40	T	Therefore, the more numbers behind the point the more precise. Well, this doesn't only apply to money, it applies to everything you measure.00:03:46	T	When I want to read a thermometer.00:03:54	T	Presume 99 is here, and here's 100.00:04:00	T	And the liquid in the thermometer reaches exactly halfway. What do you say then? What do you read in this case? Sandra?00:04:11	SN	Ninety-nine point five?00:04:13	T	Ninety-nine point five. So you're here, you want to read it and it's 99.5.00:04:20	T	True, there are no measuring stripes in between here but you can make an estimate, right?00:04:24	T	These stripes have such a distance in between them that you can see whether you are on the 99, 100, or somewhere in between.00:04:31	T	But you may not be able to see exactly if it's 99.4, or 99.5, or six. So you make an estimate.00:04:40	T	So by presenting it with one extra decimal, we can be more precise.00:04:51	T	Well, what else do I see going wrong? Here is the 90- oh, no, the 99- and here the 100, and he'll reach exactly up till here.00:05:05	T	And then I see some of you write down 99 again. Why is that incorrect?00:05:12	SN	It has to say point zero.00:05:14	T	That's right. You should add point zero, right? This way you indicate that you know it exactly up to one decimal.00:05:20	T	Even though it's a zero, it does indicate the precision, doesn't it? So don't forget this. Each time you measure something-00:05:28	T	No matter if it is a thermometer or a measuring cylinder, check to see if you can make an estimate of what's between the measuring stripes.00:05:37	T	And show this in your answer. Indicate the accuracy, okay?00:05:42	T	This time during the lab I have corrected it for most of you. But do you understand why it's like this now? Why it's good to read it this way? Yes?00:05:52	T	Okay. So much for the thermometer. Then, we've discussed the deviations, right?00:06:05	T	What could be the reason something deviates from what the theory says? Do you remember?00:06:11	SN	No.00:06:12	T	No?00:06:13	SN	No.00:06:15	T	If we measure something and the result is different from what we expected, then there's two things we can do.00:06:25	T	We can try to find an explanation for this deviation, or we can try- we can say, "That theory is completely wrong. I think it should be this and that."00:06:36	T	We are dealing with very slight deviations here, right. So in this case, we try to find an explanation for the deviation that we measure ourselves.00:06:45	T	There are substantial differences between you all individually. One had 98 degrees, the other had something over 100,00:06:51	T	One hundred and a half.00:06:55	T	But, apparently, the theory says that the boiling point of water is exactly 100, one hundred point zero degrees Celsius.00:07:03	T	Okay. Try to explain the deviation that you guys have found here. You are not allowed to write down 100 when you measure 98. Got that?00:07:11	T	Write down what you measure. Loraine?00:07:15	SN	Can the (thermometer) be broken?00:07:17	T	It can be broken, that's right. And what exactly do you mean by broken?00:07:23	S	Because it doesn't reach to 100.00:07:27	T	Yes... but something I noticed about several thermometers, and I'm not sure if that applies to your thermometers.00:07:33	T	You'll have the liquid here. It reaches, for example, 98 degrees, but here above there was a little bit of that red liquid as well.00:07:45	T	In fact, then that is still part of it, right? And that would, indeed, mean that it's broken. Was that the case with you guys?00:07:50	S	Well, ours was constantly at 98 the whole time and then it went down to 97.00:07:53	SN	Yes, we had that too.00:07:55	T	Yes... there is an explanation for that as well. What is- did you do something else when it was 98 and sunk back to 97?00:08:07	T	I did something different with most of them.00:08:10	T	I said, once it boils, the temperature isn't going to rise any further so there is no need to set that burner so high.00:08:16	T	So I just brought the burner back a little bit- the airflow, you see- so that it started burning a little less violently.00:08:24	T	We are going to take a more precise look at it now. I am holding the beaker here. Okay, the thermometer is in there with the top like this.00:08:34	T	And over here I have... the burner underneath it.00:08:39	T	That water, that can become 100 degrees at a maximum, right, according to the theory. So that's what we'll presume for the time being.00:08:47	T	But the flame, how warm can that become?00:08:50	SN	Warmer.00:08:50	T	A lot warmer, sure. It can easily become a couple of hundred degrees. That beaker, how warm could that possibly become? Yes?00:09:00	SN	(inaudible)00:09:03	T	Much warmer, of course, than that water... Yeah, the melting point of glass lies somewhere beyond 1400 degrees, right.00:09:09	T	So you need lots of heat, very special ovens in order to be able to melt it. Therefore, that beaker can also easily get warmer.00:09:19	T	As long as that flame is warmer, it can get warmer here... If I put the thermometer mostly at the bottom here,00:09:25	T	And it rests for a large part upon that beaker that gets so incredibly hot because I have that flame so high,00:09:31	T	Then I'm actually not really acting honestly, am I?00:09:35	T	Because, in fact, I'm not only measuring the temperature of the water, 00:09:40	T	but I am also measuring the beaker temperature of the bottom of the beaker, right?00:09:44	T	So that could be an explanation why, in case you have this thing on really high ...00:09:49	T	Why you could have read a higher temperature than those 100 degrees which I noticed was the case with some of you.00:09:54	T	How could you avoid this? Lydia?00:09:59	SN	By holding the thermometer up a bit higher in the glass.00:10:03	T	Correct. By making sure it's surrounded by nothing but water, right? Because the water can't get warmer. Some mentioned stirring.00:10:11	T	Well, stirring matters mostly in the beginning. Because if I'm going to warm it up, where does it get warm first?00:10:17	SN	At the bottom.00:10:18	T	Correct. That warmth comes from underneath so the water at the bottom here will become warmer than the water above.00:10:24	T	But what you want is one and the same temperature. We had an expensive word for that. What was that again?00:10:33	T	Homogenous. Homogenizing. It has to become homogenous. So you want all the qualities to be the same all over. That's what we call homogenous.00:10:47	T	Okay. What could be a reason the temperature is too low?00:10:51	SN	(What do you mean by too low?)00:10:53	T	Well, for instance, that you read 98 instead of 100. Ronald?00:10:59	SN	The burner isn't positioned properly.00:11:01	T	Yes, exactly. The burner isn't positioned exactly, right. It might be slightly to the side.00:11:06	T	If I see the way some of you guys do a lab, it's, in fact, a miracle that everything keeps standing up.00:11:10	T	The wire gauze being all rounded instead of hollow, which makes it all very unbalanced,00:11:15	T	Especially when it starts boiling and bubbling, you have to make sure it's all positioned steadily. That burner is sometimes put slightly sideways.00:11:21	T	Make sure it's standing right underneath, huh? But what's also the case, what else did I tell you about those thermometers?00:11:28	T	What were they made of in the past?00:11:30	SN	Mercury.00:11:31	T	Mercury, right? And why don't we do that anymore? Jake?00:11:35	SN	It's dangerous.00:11:36	T	It's dangerous, all right. Toxic. So we switched to alcohol-thermometers, and they just tend to be less precise.00:11:43	T	Therefore, no matter how precisely you guys measure and how precisely you read, errors are going to pop up. System errors, we call those.00:11:51	T	Errors in the equipment you use that cannot be avoided, no matter how well you do your best to be precise.00:11:58	T	All right. We could focus on that in more depth, but that's not what we're going to do today. That's not what this is meant for.00:12:03	T	I'd merely like to point out that when you measure something differently than what you would expect, then you're not gonna have to adjust it.00:12:10	T	Like some of you did, as they had a tendency to write 100 everywhere. Like, "Sure, I already know what it is."00:12:14	T	No, measuring is knowing. So even when it gives you something else than you expected, you are going to look for an explanation afterwards.00:12:22	T	Good. Then we have tried to dissolve substances like sugar in water, and once sugar in alcohol. That was the second experiment, right?00:12:31	T	Well, some did dissolve, and some didn't... What was dissolving?... Let's see. Ingrid.00:12:39	SN	That you cannot see the substance anymore. That you just see the water or the alcohol.00:12:45	T	Correct. That it's divided so small that you do not see that solid substance. Or, alternatively, that liquid. Because you can dissolve those as well-00:12:50	T	That you don't see it anymore.00:12:54	T	What is then, um, what is a characteristic of a solution? That we cannot see it anymore... yes?00:13:03	SN	It changes... the color.00:13:05	T	Not necessarily, the color doesn't have to change. If I dissolve sugar in water then it stays colorless, right? No color change.00:13:10	T	We call that clear, right, the solution is clear. And what is clear? 00:13:16	SN	//Not cloudy.00:13:17	T	//Let's see. Not cloudy.00:13:19	T	Ronald?00:13:20	SN	That you can see through it.00:13:21	T	That you can see through it. That 's something else than colorless though, isn't it? If I look at tea for example, I can see through it.00:13:28	T	It's clear, I don't see any solid substances left. Not even at the bottom. So it dissolves well. It's a solution, it's clear.00:13:35	T	But it does have a color. It may be colorless, a solution, but it may also have a color.00:13:42	T	All right. We have also made substances, or mixed substances together that didn't dissolve, can you remember?00:13:49	T	Which experiment, what substances didn't dissolve? Lydia?00:13:54	SN	Chewing gum.00:13:55	T	Chewing gum didn't dissolve. Yes?00:13:57	SN	Flour and chalk.00:14:00	T	In what?00:14:01	S	In water //and alcohol.00:14:02	T	//Yes. Chalk in alcohol and chalk in water, it didn't dissolve. Yet we want to give this mixture a name. Does anybody remember what we called it?00:14:17	T	Suspension?00:14:20	SS	We haven't gotten there yet.00:14:21	T	Not there yet? Then I'll explain it to you now. All right. There are mixtures that do not dissolve.00:14:30	T	And there are- and we can distinguish two different kinds of mixtures. One is a suspension, and the other is an emulsion.00:14:38	T	Now what's the difference? In the case of a suspension we are dealing with a solid substance that doesn't want to dissolve.00:14:44	T	For example that chalk in the alcohol, or um, for example sugar in the alcohol, or salt in alcohol... it doesn't dissolve, it becomes cloudy.00:14:54	T	It starts floating through the liquid. And should you wait long enough, it will sink to the bottom, right?00:15:00	T	Or an emulsion. And emulsion deals with two liquids... that don't dissolve into each other. So not a solid substance in a liquid but two liquids.00:15:14	T	Okay, we're going to do an experiment with that, experiment 4C and 4D. I see that all the bags are put neatly at the side.00:15:22	T	Um, you guys grab a plate, a coat, and a pair of goggles, that's all, and then you go sit down and you will get more explanation.00:15:28	SS	(Inaudible)00:15:32	SN	(Inaudible)00:15:34	T	What doesn't it say anywhere, Danielle?00:15:36	S	(That you have to take goggles).00:15:37	T	That you have to take goggles?00:15:37	SN	Yes.00:15:40	T	Yes? Is that what you wanted to say?00:15:42	S	Yes.00:15:43	T	No, but that is something we just do out of precaution. I don't want you to get any chemicals in your eye.00:15:50	OT	Have they already, uh (inaudible)?00:15:53	T	No, I haven't said, uh, anything about that yet.00:16:03	SN	These things are really dirty!00:16:04	T	Dirty? But during summer break we have sent them all to the //laundromat.00:16:07	OT	//Yeah. We've just washed them, dude.00:16:08	T	But those are stains that won't ever come off again, you know.00:16:10	SN	This one is dirty as well.00:16:13	SN	This one is too large.00:16:14	T	Right. Those can well be stains that will never come off anymore. That's the reason that you're wearing these, so that you will not get it on your clothes.00:16:19	SN	(I think this is size 48).00:16:23	T	Yes, they tend to be kind of large indeed. Why don't you roll up your sleeves a bit.00:16:36	SN	(Do you have small glasses)?00:16:39	T	Small glasses? Sure-00:16:43	OT	You have your coat on inside out.00:16:54	OT	Come on you guys, hurry up a little!00:17:06	OT	Put your coat on and sit down for a moment, then we'll explain what's the idea here.00:17:10	T	That you still dare to wear a coat with that name on it, after yesterday evening.00:17:14	SN	Yeah, who would do a thing like that!00:17:18	OT	You're wearing yours inside out!00:17:19	SN	Ha, dope! Look!00:17:20	OT	You too!00:17:21	SN	Okay, //(inaudible).00:17:22	SS	[laughter]00:17:31	OT	Just put your coat on properly.00:17:33	T	Are you guys still getting dressed by your moms, or what?00:17:36	SN	(inaudible) How many dopes do you see here?00:17:42	T	Look, you're starting wrong, you see?00:17:43	SS	[laughter]00:17:44	SN	Yes, what difference does it make which button is in //what hole?00:17:45	T	//This way it's just sort of hanging here. //Look, here you're not matching ends. You have a button here but not there.00:17:48	SN	//Yes.00:17:51	SS	Dope!00:17:54	SN	Is that bad?00:17:55	T	Go ahead and sit down, in your case it doesn't matter.00:18:01	OT	Sit down for a moment and listen to what the objective is. Experiment 4C and D, page 67. At 4C, at assignments.00:18:15	OT	The author of the book has, uh, forgotten one little line because at A it says: Put a spatula point of chalk in a test tube.00:18:24	OT	Which, by the way, we already have all set for us here, it already contains a bit of chalk.00:18:28	OT	And then at B it says: Shake well, but that's of course not going to be any good unless you add a little water first.00:18:34	OT	That's what I mean. And when we talk about water in chemistry we always say: demiwater or distilled water.00:18:43	OT	Which is kept in those little bottles. And for B if you need lamp oil or dishwashing detergent than you can grab these things from over here.00:18:56	OT	For A you can find what you need over here- by the way you'll also need a little rack to put the test tube in.00:19:04	OT	And if there are no questions then you can now start with A. Everybody keeps their goggles on though!00:19:11	SS	(inaudible)00:19:14	SN	(inaudible)00:19:15	OT	The racks are back there.00:19:18	T	First a pair of goggles on and then you come get your things, //hey?00:19:20	OT	//First put the goggles //on.00:19:21	SN	Yes, now I'm doing it correctly.00:19:27	SN	Miss? //And then you pick up your things, right?00:19:28	T	//Yes?00:19:32	T	Sure, because than you can get rid of them right away, you see? That's a lot more practical.00:19:36	OT	Go ahead, go ahead and all three of you do B. //No, no (inaudible).00:19:38	SS	//(inaudible)00:19:40	T	That's the next experiment, that's still coming up.00:19:48	T	Who had the class folder, guys?00:19:49	SN	Not me. Not me either.00:19:51	T	You? Ah. I have signed it already. so that you can bring it along right away, otherwise you might forget it later.00:20:05	T	During this lab you may sit down. We're not working with a burner so you are allowed to sit down if you prefer that.00:20:12	T	Ooh, How clumsily!00:20:14	SN	Yes.00:20:15	T	Look, it's almost empty which makes it more difficult. If you hold it at an angle, then you are only squeezing a bit of air, right?00:20:20	T	So hold it upright and as soon as it's no longer immersed you better refill it.00:20:25	SN	Do we shake it like this?00:20:26	T	No, you were provided with a plug, weren't you? Because this way you'll get it on your thumb, you see, that's not allowed.00:20:35	SN	Do I have to add lamp oil //to this right away?00:20:36	SN	No.00:20:37	T	No! //Read carefully!00:20:38	SN	//You've got to empty it out-00:20:41	SN	Oh, fill up with two centimeters of water.00:20:43	SN	Demiwater.00:20:46	T	Oh, oh. You're lucky that it didn't break.00:20:48	S	I've done that before.00:20:51	OT	Shake well... and read well what you're supposed to do!00:20:54	T	Where do you have the chalk?00:20:56	S	What chalk?00:20:57	T	Didn't you have a test tube with chalk?00:20:58	S	I threw it away.00:21:00	T	Why?00:21:02	S	It has water in it already.00:21:03	T	So you want to get a new tube for that second experiment, or what are you doing?00:21:06	S	Yes.00:21:07	T	Ohh! You can also ask for a new tube over there, you know.00:21:10	SN	A new test tube?00:21:11	SN	Yes.00:21:12	T	And look, rinsing, that's something we always just do with tap water, that doesn't matter. Only when we do a real experiment, then we get that water.00:21:17	S	Would this be two centimeters?00:21:19	T	Yes, but as you can see, there is still a little chalk in there, you see?00:21:21	T	Here... here is a new test tube.00:21:23	T	It's still slightly cloudy, see that?00:21:24	SN	What is the purpose of this cork?00:21:27	SN	Miss?00:21:29	T	So that shortly you can shake it well.00:21:31	SN	(inaudible) we already had that, didn't we?00:21:33	T	Uh huh. Yes, but you haven't had the concept of suspension yet and that's what this is about.00:21:38	SN	What kind of substance does not dissolve?00:21:40	T	Yes.00:21:42	S	And then the experiment is done?00:21:44	T	And then the experiment is done. And you may start the next one.00:21:44	SS	(inaudible)00:21:49	SN	Do you need this for the second time again instead of (those over there)?00:21:51	T	You can also get a new tube, there are plenty of tubes over there.00:21:54	SN	Yes, fine.00:22:00	SN	Do you have to, uh, get a new test tube then?00:22:02	T	Yes, at the front are plenty of tubes left so you can go ahead and help yourself to //a new one.00:22:05	S	//Yes, but this one is pretty clean.00:22:06	T	No problem, in that case you use that one.00:22:10	T	You know what I saw you doing just now, Sandra?00:22:11	SN	Yes?00:22:12	T	You did it this way, didn't you? //I don't know how tight you fastened the plug, but it can't be too tight, right?00:22:14	SN	//Yes... yes.00:22:17	T	Because then the glass would break so you just insert it gently but actually you should keep your finger on it just in case, yes?00:22:23	S	Yes, okay.00:22:24	T	Otherwise you'll end up with a little puddle here.00:22:27	S	Right.00:22:32	S	Um, I think we have to do our second experiment now.00:22:35	S	With lamp oil and dishwashing detergent.00:22:38	SN	That's right.00:22:39	SN	Then we have to remove this-00:22:40	T	Walter?00:22:41	SN	Yes.00:22:42	T	Will you please start writing a little more neatly? It's totally illegible what is written here.00:22:46	SN	(inaudible)00:22:47	T	Yes, really, I don't find it neat. It's impossible to read. Can you read this?00:22:55	SN	Well, I just happen to know, eh, what it's supposed to say, so -00:22:59	SN	Yes, look! Uh, no- [laughter]00:23:04	T	Sure enough, that's okay if you guys see this... Look, if you know what it 's supposed to say then you get it, but I just find it too messy!00:23:10	SN	//No, it's beautiful. Look I can even read it upside down!00:23:15	T	You can, but I cannot and I just want you to put more effort into your handwriting, just work on it, will you?00:23:22	T	Yes, and I think this is very messy, too!00:23:45	T	Moreover, I'm noticing that you haven't completed everything in chapter three yet.00:23:49	SN	What?00:23:50	T	I'm seeing way too many empty questions in there.00:23:58	S	This?00:23:59	T	No, in chapter three. We have finished chapter three completely. But these questions here haven't been done yet,00:24:05	T	This hasn't been done, this here, all open, here.00:24:08	T	This here's a lab so at least you've written that down, but the homework over here, none of that has been done.00:24:17	T	I suggest that this afternoon after school you'll come and sit with me for an hour and then you're going to work on it.00:24:23	T	Because you're obviously not doing any of it at home, so you're going to do it with me. All right?00:24:30	S	All right.00:24:31	T	How many class periods do you have left today?00:24:32	S	Uh, until... two o'clock.00:24:35	T	Two o'clock. So at the seventh period you'll go over to room 64, okay? And there you're going to catch up.00:24:41	SN	Miss?00:24:42	T	Yes?00:24:43	S	Do you have to, over here, do you have to... do you have to (get) a new test tube?00:24:49	T	Yes, go ahead and get a new one!00:24:51	S	At least one, uh, (inaudible).00:24:52	T	Get a new one because then you can compare it well. No! A new one! So you'll leave this one standing in here.00:24:58	SN	Oh.00:25:05	T	Lydia, this is not the intention. You should stay on that side because that way they have some space too.00:25:18	T	And these chairs we're going to keep them standing like this.00:25:22	SN	No, that was already sitting like this.00:25:23	T	Oops!00:25:29	T	Did you shake this already?00:25:30	S	Yes.00:25:31	T	Did you do so very firmly?00:25:32	S	Yes.00:25:33	T	What did you see then?00:25:35	S	Everything mixed up.00:25:36	T	So well blended, then.00:25:37	S	Yes.00:25:38	T	Yes. And after one minute?00:25:41	S	It went back up.00:25:42	T	Then it parted again, didn't it. All right.00:25:50	T	Ah, that is at least some firm shaking you're doing there.00:25:53	SN	Yes, we did that too. Except after a while it sort of moves //back up.00:25:55	SN	//It goes back up.00:25:56	T	Yes, that 's also a question, isn't it?00:25:59	SN	Yes, so this is an emulsion.00:26:01	SS	(You already did that twice.) (shake it well) (angled) (Oh, after one minute) (rinse it out)00:26:13	SN	Miss?00:26:14	T	Yes?00:26:14	S	(inaudible) when this substance goes up to the top of the test tube, doesn't it have the highest resolution level or something?00:26:20	T	The substance that has the highest resolution is below.00:26:22	S	Oh, then water has the highest resolution level.00:26:26	T	If you're in doubt, you could always look it up in the back of your table booklet, right?00:26:29	S	Yes.00:26:30	SN	It foams, miss.00:26:31	T	Yes?00:26:32	SN	(inaudible) it's because it's dishwashing detergent.00:26:34	SN	Oh, yes, I'll be darned!00:26:35	SN	(foams)00:26:36	T	Do you ever wash dishes at home?00:26:37	S	No.00:26:38	SN	(inaudible) have a dishwasher.00:26:39	T	That's right, huh, you all have dishwashers at home these days.00:26:41	SN	Not me, I have to wash dishes every day.00:26:43	T	Really?00:26:44	S	Yes.00:26:47	T	That's good upbringing.00:26:48	SN	(not really)00:26:50	T	We don't have a dishwasher at home either.00:26:52	SN	You know what my dad says? As long as we have you guys, we will not need a dishwasher.00:26:54	T	Right.00:26:55	SN	My daddy says the same!00:26:56	T	[laughter]00:26:57	SN	I only have to do dishes when I am late for dinner.00:27:00	T	Yes.00:27:01	S	So, that's //everyday.00:27:02	SN	//(inaudible)00:27:08	SN	Pink below... pinkish (inaudible)00:27:16	SS	(inaudible) (we have a milkshake)00:27:21	T	Did you make a solution?00:27:23	SN	Huh?00:27:24	T	Did you make a solution?00:27:25	S	Uh... I did here.00:27:27	SN	No.00:27:28	T	Why-00:27:29	SN	No, because it's not clear.00:27:30	T	It's not clear, is it? So then it's not a solution. Though it is //mixed together.00:27:32	S	//It is going to sink, just like that one. That one was okay as well.00:27:34	T	It's not a solution. So then what is it? A suspension or an emulsion?00:27:39	S	Uh... a suspension?00:27:41	T	Why?00:27:42	S	Because it doesn't dissolve into each other.00:27:44	T	Yes, but then it could still be an emulsion, couldn't it? What was the difference again between a suspension and an emulsion?00:27:52	SN	With one it's a solid substance, and with the other it's a liquid (inaudible).00:27:56	T	Exactly. Look for yourself, it's even written on the blackboard.00:27:58	S	Yes, that's why I know it!00:27:59	T	And so, what have you got?00:28:02	SN	Suspension was... oh, yes.00:28:05	T	Yes?00:28:06	S	Yes. We made an emulsion.00:28:07	T	Yes, you've made an emulsion. Therefore, a real milkshake, that's?00:28:13	S	Emulsion.00:28:14	T	Is also an emulsion, right?00:28:15	SN	(Miss)?00:28:16	T	Yes? Are you done? Then you can clean up.00:28:19	SN	(inaudible)00:28:20	T	Yes?00:28:21	SN	(Is this normal)? Look here.00:28:22	T	You may never push it in that deeply, because a little test tube like that breaks easily. The idea is to shut it off, but it is,00:28:30	T	Uh, not meant to be like this.00:28:32	SN	Oh. We never learned that. He didn't say it.00:28:38	T	That's just using your common sense a little more.00:28:41	S	(Well, that's kind of difficult).00:28:42	T	Oh well, it didn't break. All right, go ahead and clean up.00:28:46	T	And because you guys were finished this quickly, you can do clean-up duty.00:28:51	T	That gives you enough time to pick up the coats from the floor, arrange them by size, et cetera.00:28:55	SN	//(inaudible)00:28:56	T	//Huh?00:28:56	S	(inaudible) (through the room with the coats).00:29:00	OT	When you guys are done, you rinse the tubes thoroughly, //and clean everything up.00:29:02	T	//You picked them up from over there?00:29:03	S	Yes, (inaudible).00:29:07	T	Aha. In that case just hang them back //neatly.00:29:08	SN	//Miss, the function of (inaudible).00:29:11	T	No, the function of the dish-00:29:14	SN	Here, this is the oil.00:29:16	T	We call the whole emulsion, and the dishwashing detergent is what we call the emulsifier. So that is the substance that- what do you have in your hair here?00:29:25	SN	It's strange, isn't it?00:29:26	SN	Yes, I told you this morning.00:29:27	SN	A leaf! //Yes, I was biking through the forest this morning and an acorn hit me in the head which made me ride into a tree.00:29:28	T	//Yes, so- [laughter] Yes?00:29:32	S	Yes.00:29:35	T	So the soap is the emulsifier and that's the substance that prevents the two liquids from separating.00:29:41	T	So that's the function of the soap. Making sure that the two liquids don't separate.00:29:47	T	Because here they separated, didn't they?00:29:49	S	Yes.00:29:49	T	Here it's not a mixture anymore. So the soap makes that those two liquids that don't dissolve into each other, that they do not separate. Sandra.00:29:59	SN	I have a problem. I can't get the lid on this because of the dishwashing liquid. It keeps popping off.00:30:03	T	Yes? It's well stuck on this way. This is far enough. Just close off, that's the main thing. Then you can start shaking it firmly.00:30:10	S	Okay.00:30:12	T	Turn a little bit, wet it a little bit that might help sometimes, when it's dry it's more difficult, when it's wet it goes smoother.00:30:18	SN	(dishwashing detergent underneath)00:30:21	T	Well, now you have to shake harder.00:30:26	T	That's why you shouldn't fill up the test tube too much, then it's harder to shake, you make sure you have a little space left.00:30:31	SN	(inaudible). Wait a second, dishwashing detergent underneath.00:30:35	SN	Oh, no! Come on!00:30:40	S	That is the dishwashing detergent.00:30:41	SN	It's come off again! I did it again!00:30:44	T	Now, what do you see? Yes?00:30:45	SN	(dishwashing detergent goes up)00:30:46	SN	The emulsifier (inaudible) causes the substances not to separate.00:30:49	T	Correct. Very well. What do you see here?00:30:53	SN	Dishwashing detergent. [laughter]00:30:56	T	Was that dishwashing detergent red, then?00:30:57	S	No, oh, no that has been, uh, been mixed with water and dishwashing liquid.00:31:02	T	The dishwashing detergent has been added. But what's this here?00:31:06	S	(inaudible)00:31:07	T	It's a pity you have thrown that other tube away, but look behind you for a moment. Do you see those differences?00:31:15	T	A moment ago you saw the difference between the water and the lamp oil very clearly. And now you see that it has been mixed a lot more here.00:31:23	T	This is not clear anymore, this is mixed. So the two liquids are mixed together. So oil and water have been mixed together?00:31:29	T	In the end it will sag a bit again, but not nearly as fast as when you would not add any soap, right?00:31:35	S	Yes.00:31:38	T	So what did we make here? A? A mixture of two liquids that didn't dissolve into each other and what do we call such thing?00:31:45	SN	Emulsion.00:31:46	T	An emulsion, well done.00:31:48	SN	(inaudible) both substances. So it has a, uh, (I think) a higher density.00:32:10	SN	[laughter] Yes, what, um, what is the function of the dishwashing detergent?00:32:15	T	My god, you guys started your homework at your own impulse. Very good, very good, you are learning, Jake, you are learning!00:32:20	SN	(inaudible) I have finished everything!00:32:22	T	Yes.00:32:23	SN	We were supposed to have finished up to 21A, right?00:32:25	T	Yes, that's right. Ha, it 's getting somewhere.00:32:27	S	Yes, um, miss, does question eight apply to the lab or not?00:32:32	T	No, because it doesn't have a gray stripe, does it?00:32:35	S	Yeah, I thought-00:32:36	T	And everything that has a gray stripe is lab, so these are regular questions, right? And you also could have noticed this because, uh, the question has a number, you see?00:32:44	S	(Do we have to do that much)?00:32:46	SN	Neat, //huh?00:32:47	T	//Yes.00:32:49	SN	We are on duty!00:32:50	SN	//Uh, the boiling point of acetone?00:32:51	T	//Yes?00:32:52	OT	(Is this) homework?00:32:53	T	Yes, this is homework. Homework is written on the blackboard, guys, so if you're done then you can continue with homework.00:33:00	SN	I already finished that.00:33:01	SN	Miss? How can you, uh, an emulsifier is a substance that- how can you, what is the best way to describe that?00:33:08	T	Yes, what is that substance doing?00:33:09	S	Yes, mix with another substance.00:33:11	T	Yes.00:33:12	SN	Can I throw this away?00:33:13	T	Hold on for a second, I just want to explain something to him and then you may throw it away. Here that one isn't added, is it?00:33:19	SN	No.00:33:20	T	So here I have two liquids that do not dissolve into each other.00:33:22	S	Yes.00:33:23	T	And they have gotten separated again, not mixed anymore we call separated. Here, however, it's still mixed. So what does that soap do?00:33:32	T	And the oil, so that soap causes the oil and the water to stay mixed.00:33:33	S	Mix it with water.00:33:36	S	Yes.00:33:37	T	If I'd want to say this very generally I could say the emulsifier causes two liquids that don't dissolve into each other to stay mixed.00:33:45	S	Yes.00:33:46	T	Yes? Here, Walter, you can clean up now.00:33:49	SN	May the glasses come off?00:33:51	T	No, because you're still handling substances.00:34:02	T	Homework is on the blackboard. You can begin with it once you're done.00:34:09	T	//Book and workbook as well?00:34:10	OT	//(We will quickly) clean up the supplies, yes?00:34:12	SN	Why don't we have 4.1B?00:34:16	T	Because the introduction about water is so simple, and B are the more complicated sections, therefore they didn't- the section just isn't there.00:34:24	S	So it's not difficult?00:34:26	T	Not section one, no. That wasn't difficult, was it? That was just sort of about what kinds of water there are and all that?00:34:32	S	(inaudible) heat up, heat the water up. That's not that difficult.00:34:36	T	No, now you're talking about lab. I'm talking about the theory in your book.00:34:39	S	Oh, yes. That's not difficult either.00:34:41	T	That was only about what kinds of water there are. Surface water and (heaven) water and so on.00:34:45	S	But you have to study that as well, right?00:34:46	T	Sure, it's something you should know. But it's not so hard in the sense that they should dedicate an extra section to that. Yes?00:34:56	T	Is it going all right over there? Okay.00:34:58	SN	(What is this)? They've never had service this good before!00:35:01	T	Really?00:35:02	SN	Yes. Ronald took my coat for me.00:35:13	T	Well, this is a slow row here. Everybody is still working.00:35:17	SS	(inaudible). Let's see, finish up to 4.2. I have done up to four.00:35:24	SS	You've got to (inaudible). (Yes, that is correct).00:35:28	SN	Miss, why isn't there a section 4.B?00:35:30	T	That's what he just asked as well. Because that section is so easy, and B is meant for an in-depth section.00:35:35	T	That focuses on the matter a little more deeply, but that's not possible with this subject.00:35:38	S	Oh.00:35:45	T	Gosh, you're taking it for them. What a gentleman!00:35:48	SS	(inaudible) otherwise they all have to (inaudible).00:35:52	SN	Yes, normally they have to clean everything up.00:35:53	T	Yes- [laughter]00:35:55	SN	(Yes, usually they have to clean everything).00:35:57	T	They may think that this was planned.00:35:59	SN	What's this thing in cola that makes ( ) it bubbles?00:36:04	T	It starts bubbling?00:36:05	S	Well, yes, that it, uh, all that carbon dioxide and all.00:36:08	T	Yes, carbon dioxide is a gas. And that gas gets released so you see that as bubbles. But that is not a question in here, is it?00:36:18	S	No, but when you open a bottle of sparkling water then you see little bubbles everywhere. It seems as though sparkling water is boiling.00:36:27	T	Ah, yes. And what is boiling? You've got to first check up on the definition, right? What's boiling?00:36:34	S	(inaudible)00:36:36	T	That it starts bubbling.00:36:37	T	Now with sparkling water there are bubbles released as well, but is that the same thing?00:36:40	S	No.00:36:41	T	No. What is the difference? Why isn't that boiling?00:36:45	S	(It is also not warm, right?)00:36:48	T	Precisely. What is the boiling point of water?00:36:51	S	Hundred degrees.00:36:51	T	Hundred degrees. Well, normal SPA isn't 100 degrees, so then it must be something different. It's the gasses in there. It's not boiling.00:36:58	S	Okay.00:37:04	T	John, go ahead and start your homework.00:37:06	S	Well, I finished it already.00:37:07	T	You finished it already? Did you correct it already as well?00:37:10	S	No.00:37:12	T	You can do that with those white folders, remember?00:37:13	S	I am working ahead for the time being.00:37:14	T	That's allowed. But then you still have to correct it at home, right?00:37:16	S	Yes.00:37:17	SN	What is an emulsifier?00:37:18	T	An emulsifier, in fact the soap you used during the experiment that's the emulsifier, and that causes the two liquids to not dissolve into each other00:37:28	T	Like in this case the water and the oil.00:37:30	SN	It's pretty weird.00:37:32	T	Yeah, that's quite a- so it causes them to stay mixed, not dissolved because you still cannot see through the mixture so it's not a solution.00:37:40	S	It only stays mixed if-00:37:41	T	It stays mixed together.00:37:43	T	True, if you wouldn't have the soap in there but with the soap it stayed mixed much longer, even without shaking. At last it sags anyway.00:37:50	T	Soap is not a very good emulsifier, but it stays mixed much longer then it would if I wouldn't have the soap there.00:37:56	SN	(inaudible) after one minute (inaudible).00:37:58	T	Yes.00:37:59	S	(soap)00:37:59	SN	Miss! (inaudible)00:38:03	T	No, you have to hand your coat over to them.00:38:05	SN	Yes.00:38:07	T	Walter! Walter! Don't start wrestling! Take off your coat and hand it in orderly!00:38:14	SN	You should throw it over them.00:38:15	SS	Yes. (inaudible) Yes. [laughter]00:38:21	T	Walter!00:38:30	SN	Anything left? Is it all cleared?00:38:33	T	Is everything neat? Okay, come sit down, then.00:38:40	T	Thank you for cleaning up... But do you understand it now?00:38:44	SN	Yes.00:38:45	T	It's not a very good emulsifier and if you wait long enough then it will separate.00:38:49	T	But it will stay mixed much longer than when I wouldn't have added the soap. Okay?00:38:55	T	Yes?00:38:56	SN	Miss?00:38:59	T	Nah, that-00:39:00	S	But it does look neat this way.00:39:01	T	Yes... but the next time I'll check whether you guys manage to make it just as neat.00:39:05	SN	(But we've already been)00:39:06	T	Anyway your turn will come up more than once a year, you see?00:39:09	S	Yes, but there are a lot who haven't been yet.00:39:10	T	//Yes... Yes, what did you want to ask me?00:39:11	SN	//(inaudible)00:39:14	SN	At question 14, do you put more sugar in tea?00:39:20	T	Yes.00:39:21	SN	Yes.00:39:21	SN	Yes.00:39:22	SN	No, but //(inaudible)00:39:24	SN	Yes, but (inaudible)00:39:27	T	No, then you have to stir a little longer. It sometimes just takes time.00:39:30	S	And if it is too cold then, would it still dissolve?00:39:32	T	Yes, but it's more difficult and you can dissolve less in it. You've done an experiment in which you also had cold water with a little bit of sugar.00:39:38	T	And that dissolved all right, only you had to shake a little longer, it sometimes takes more time.00:39:43	S	Oh, right (inaudible).00:39:44	T	Yes, when it gets warmer it's going better, you're right about that.00:39:57	SN	Miss, how do you calculate density?00:40:02	T	That part you are going to do with me in the lesson. That homework hasn't been done yet. Now you're working on Chapter 4.00:40:06	S	Homework is up till two point four? //That includes this, doesn't it?00:40:09	T	//Yes, but.
